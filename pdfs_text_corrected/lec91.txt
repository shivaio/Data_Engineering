this  is  where  we  left  off  in  the  last  class  so  we  look  at  three  networks  for  image 
classification  starting  with  alex  net  then  zf  net  and  then  vgg  net  vgg  net  in 
particular  had  sixteen  layers  including  convolutions  and  fully  connected  layers  and  one 
thing that we saw that a large number of parameters are there in the first fully connected 
layer 
because you are connecting a five hundred and twelve 
seven + seven volume to a four thousand and ninety-six dimensional vector right so 
that is one thing the other thing that i would like to kind of mention right now so that it 
becomes useful for the later part of the lecture is that if i look at any of these pink boxes 
here right or even these things which are known as the fully connected layers and if i 
just flatten them out and view them as a vector what does that vector actually capture 
it captures a it captures an abstract representation of the image right 
so now imagine what would happen is suppose you have trained one of these networks 
alex net vgg net or any of your favorite networks and by what i mean by training is 
that you have been tracking the cross entropy laws and you have run it for several epochs 
 
with some patience and so on and i was satisfied with whatever training error you are 
getting and you have stopped training now right 
now  after  this  if  i  pass  images  through  these  net  through  this  network  and  i  take  the 
representation from any of these boxes or from the fully connected layer what is it that i 
have essentially got now i have got an abstract representation of the image that i have 
been feeding it right so just remember this and this is something that we will use 
so  this  is  very  common  to  do  so  you  have  a  trained  image  net  many  people  have 
released different models for image net the ones which we have covered being included 
them  and  now  for  him  any  image  task  if  you  want  to  do  some  processing  then  it’s 
common to take the strain network pass your image through that 
so  you  can  train  any  you  can  use  any  image  trained  image  net  and  pass  that  image 
through it or sorry any trained convolutional network trained on image net and pass the 
image through that and you can get a representation for that image and these are known 
as the fc representations and these are as the convolution representations ok any of the 
convolution layers fine
