now since i mentioned rl so we will go on to the next chapter which was now 
becoming much more ambitious with what you can do with deep learning and people 
started beating humans at their own game quite literally 
so there was this starting with atari games in two thousand and fifteen where resources from deep mind 
show that you could train a deep neural network to play atari games and do much better 
than what humans do so that is something that they were able to show on atari games 
and then people started looking at other game 
so then there was this go and this popular tournament and which alphago which is 
deep reinforcement learning based agent was actually able to beat the reigning champion 
at that time one of the best players of go at that time 
then   even   at   poker   were   something   known   as   deepstack   which   is   again   a   deep 
reinforcement learning based agent which is able to beat eleven professional poker players at 
this game 
then other games like defense of the ancients since on which is a much more complex 
strategy based game where again deep reinforcement learning based agents have shown a 
lot of success in beating top professional players on this game
