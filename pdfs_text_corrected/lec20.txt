lecture â€“ three 
in  this  module we will  try to  learn  these parameters  and  initially  we will  try to  learn 
them by guesswork and i will show that that is actually infeasible that is why we need a 
more principled approach 
so we will keep the supervised machine learning setup in mind and now we will focus 
on this model and discuss an algorithm for learning the parameters which are w and b 
given some data using a giving appropriate function objective function so that is what 
we are going to focus on 
now sigma here stands for the sigmoid function the logistic function in this case when 
this sigma is actually the logistic function and now i am going to simplify this further 
so that it helps us to do a better analysis i am just going to consider the case where i 
am just in one input and the bias ok and also following the normal terminology in the 
literature this w naught from now on i am going to call it b because that is the normal 
convention b stands for bias 
so i have two parameters w and b which i need to estimate ok and this is my model for 
the movie example and the other change which i am going to make is instead of 
deciding whether i like or dislike which is one zero the setup that i am going to work with is 
that i am giving the critics rating and i want to predict the imdb rating so i am given 
a real value and i also want to predict a real value 
for no particular reason this just makes life easier for me for explaining a few things but 
the same thing or the same algorithm would also hold if you add a binary output right 
and you will see that later on in the course so here is a setup clear we just have two 
parameters w and b and we are going to assume that y belongs to real numbers it is a 
imdb rating and x also belongs to real number it is a critics rating 
now let us see what we are given as training is a set of points we are given some n 
training pairs and now we understand what this means that means for a lot of movie i 
am giving the critics rating and i am also given the true imdb rating for them of 
course in the two variable case this does not make much sense but just bear with me 
and now the training objective is such that whatever my function predicts which is a 
function of w x and b that should be very close to the true output that i know this is the 
function that i want to optimize now let me ask you this 
i am trying to tell you that i am going to give you an algorithm for training this network 
suppose i have trained this with two data points five comma two and twenty-five comma nine right 
at the end of training i will give you some values of w and b let us call them w star 
and b star these are the final values of w which i have given w and b what do you 
expect from these values 
what do you expect at the end of training if i say now the network has learned what do 
you expect you are still going to the test case i am just talking about the training still 
we expect such that what happens if i plug in at the end of training if i plug in the value 
five here what should happen 
nine so this is what you expect at the end of training if you plug in the value five it 
should be very close to two the output and if you plug in the value twenty-five it should be very 
close to nine 
this is exactly what you expect and this is what training means ok fine in other words 
we hope to find a sigmoid function such that these two points lie on that function can 
you imagine a geometric picture for this what would happen actually how many if we 
can imagine it ok how many of you get it now this is what will happen right so you 
will get a sigmoid function such that these two points lie on that fair ok and that exactly 
means that when i plug in this value i will get this value and when i plug in this value i 
will get this value right so that is what it means 
so let us see this in more detail 
and now what we will do is our quest is for this w star and b star i will try to find this 
manually i will do some random guesswork and try to find this because i do not have 
any clear principle algorithm for finding it as of now so i will just use some guesswork 
so i will give my initial guesswork as w equal to five b equal to zero for no reason i just 
picked up some values right and this is what the function that i got what does this 
mean this function an error so the sigmoid formula should be here we should have this 
sigmoid formula here 
so is this a good are you happy with the solution if i give you are you happy with this 
solution is this good bad ugly has to be something bad we will not call it ugly ok 
so why is it bad it is not passing through those points i will ask you a question how 
bad is it can you assign a number to it we are always good at qualitative stuff but 
quantitatively can you tell me a number how bad is this can you tell me a way of 
finding how bad this is i already told you in detail how to find that how bad it is 
the loss function right 
we have the loss function let us see that again and see if we can find out how bad this is 
so this is what my loss function is ok and i have two data points i will just expand it out 
fine now i will plug in the values i know this is nine and i will compute the value of f 
twenty-five i will plug in this and i will plug in this ok and this is what i get so this is how bad 
it is what did we actually expect it to be in the good case zero so this is not zero this is 
seventy-three so now we have a quantitative handle on how bad this is ok so let us keep this 
in mind and let us try to continue guessing so we want the loss function to be asked 
close to zero as possible we are not there yet 
so then i make a different guess i say let me try minus ten zero what happened now 
is it now good bad ugly 
now let us call it ugly right so it is worse and how do i know it is worse because i 
plugged it in to the loss function and i got a value which is greater than the value at 
which i was so i clearly know this is bad 
so now this is how my mind is working right oh i as far as w was positive things looked 
at least i was close to zero in the first decimal now when i made it negative that does not 
look good so let me just keep it positive and keep increasing it right so i saw ninety-four and 
i also tweaked the b of it i have done complete random guesswork right now what 
happened good bad ugly 
better ok now what will you do what would your next case would be make w even 
more positive perhaps that would help and be even more negative and so on 
i can continue in this manner and actually get close very close to the solution so i can 
do this guesswork and find these values but it is still an educated guess right i am not 
guessing in the dark this is what is helping me drive towards those guesses and i am just 
looking at these values and making an educated guess right and that is the educated 
guess which i took that probably making w even more positive would help but this is 
still brute force in a sense right this is not something that you would want to do when 
you have one hundred one thousand parameters and so on right and one million data points and so on 
so let us look at something which is better than our guesswork algorithm ah so we are 
not there yet actually on the next slide i am still going to talk about the guesswork 
algorithm 
and eventually we will get to something which is better than the guesswork that ok 
so since we have only two points and two parameters what i can do is i can take all 
possible values of w and b right that is what i was trying i was picking up some values 
of w and b why just pick some values of w and b i will pick all possible values of w 
comma b right and i will fix the range i cannot fix pick it from minus infinity to 
infinity but i will pick a range i will say from minus six to six let me try all values of w 
comma b compute the loss and plot it right let me tell something about this error 
function because this is going to stay with us for quite some time 
so what you see here is something like a flying carpet this is colour coded red is bad 
red are the places where the error is high blue is good blue are the places where the 
error is low darker the shade of blue lower the error darker the shade of red higher the 
error so in particular if i look at this point what has happened is i have taken the 
corresponding value of w comma b right which is say minus four comma minus one right 
something like that 
i have plugged that value into my loss function and i got this as the loss function this 
has the loss value and that is what i have plotted for all values between minus six to plus six 
and minus six to plus six for w and b so everyone understands how i have constructed this 
error surface 
now this of course becomes and now what i can do is once i see this error surface i 
know how good this is the point where i need to be this is the darkest ah shade and this 
is where the error is the lowest so i can just pick a w comma b value which lies there 
this is fine for this toy example where you just have two parameters but this becomes 
untractable once you have more data points and many more parameters 
and that is what happens in most real world applications right so this is not a feasible 
way of going about things right and here again note that i have only taken the range 
from minus six to six i do not even know what will happen if i have to look at all values of 
w comma b right maybe there was something outside here right which was even more 
lower error or something right so i do not really know that 
so i cannot really use this so i need something better than this plotting the error 
everywhere and finding it order that is pure brute force or surrogate to this was the 
guesswork algorithm but which is again something we cannot do for if you have large 
number of parameters 
so everyone gets this that this is a way of finding the solution but this is not feasible 
right that is the only point i am trying to make 
and we look at the geometric interpretation of what was actually happening in the case 
of the guesswork algorithm with respect to the error surface 
so i had chosen some values of w comma b the first value that i chose actually gave me 
an error of if you remember it was some seventy-three or something like that right so that is the 
point then i decided to take a very random guess and my error actually increased so 
you see that i am actually climbing up on this error surface i have gone from a slightly 
darker shade of blue to a lighter shade of blue right and then i corrected myself and then 
kept moving in a direction where i was going towards the darker and darker shades of 
blue 
so what i was actually doing is i was trying to traverse the error surface and land up in 
the good regions which were the dark blue regions now what i want to do is i want an 
algorithm which will allow me to do this in a principled manner which is neither brute 
force nor guesswork so that is what we learn in that module
