lecture â€“ two 
power of mlps 
so welcome to lecture two of cs seven thousand and fifteen which is the course on deep learning so we will 
talk about mcculloch pitts neuron thresholding logic perceptrons and a learning 
algorithm for perceptrons and talk about the convergence of this algorithm and then we 
will talk about multilayer network of perceptrons and finally the representation power 
of perceptrons 
so  let us start module one which is on biological neurons  so  remember during the 
history we had started all the way back  in the 1880s when we spoke about biological 
neurons  so  we will just start there spend a few minutes on it and then go on to the 
computational models which is mcculloch pitts neuron 
so now this is a course on deep learning so we are going to talk about deep neural 
networks now the most fundamental unit of a deep neural network is something known 
as an artificial neuron 
and the question is why is it called a neuron where does the inspiration come from so 
we already know that the inspiration comes from biology and more specifically it comes 
from the brain because we saw that way back in the 1890s this term neuron was coined 
for neural processing units or the cells in our brain 
so now before we move on to the computational neurons or the artificial neurons we 
will just see the biological neurons in a bit more detail and then we will move on from 
there 
so this is what a typical biological neuron looks like  so  here actually there are two 
neurons this portion is called the dendrite so it is used to receive inputs from all the 
other neurons 
so that is the place where the input comes in then remember we said that in 1950s we 
discovered that these neurons are actually discrete cells and there is something which 
connects them so that connection is called a synapse and it decides the strength of the 
connection between these two neurons so there is an input there is some strength to the 
connection 
then once this neuron receives inputs from various other neurons it starts processing it 
so that is the central processing unit which is called the soma and once it is done this 
processing it will it is ready to send its output to other set of neurons so that output is 
carried on by the axon so we have inputs we have some weights attached to the input 
we have some processing and then an output so that is what a typical biological neuron 
looks like 
and let us see a very cartoonish illustration of how this works right how the neuron 
works so our sense organs interact with the outside world and then they pass on this 
information to the neuron and then the neuron decides whether i need to take some 
action in this case the action could be whether i it should laugh or not right whether the 
input is really funny enough to evoke laughter  so  if that happens this is known as 
something that the neuron has fired 
now of course in reality it is not just a single neuron which does all this there is a 
massively parallel interconnected network of neurons so you see a massive network 
here now the neurons in the lower level site so these neurons they actually interact 
with the sensory organs they do some processing based on the inputs  so  they decide 
whether i should fire or not 
and if they fire they transmit this information to the next set of neurons and this process 
continues till the information is relayed all the way back and then finally you decide 
whether you need to take any action or not again in which this case it should be laughter 
so  that is how it works and when i say massively parallel interconnected network i 
really mean it because there are ten raise to eleven which is roughly one hundred billion neurons 
in the brain 
now this massively parallel network also ensures that there is some division of work 
now what do you mean by that is not that every neuron is responsible for taking care of 
whether i should laugh or not or not every neuron is responsible for processing visual 
data some neurons may possess visual data some neurons may possess speeds data and 
so on so there is this division of work every neuron has a certain role to play so for 
example in this cartoonish example that we took 
so there might be this one neuron which fires if the visuals are funny right whatever you 
are seeing is funny there will be one neuron which finds sheldons speech to be funny 
the way he speaks  so  that might be funny and there might be another neuron which 
actually   finds   the   dialogue   content   to   be   funny  and   now   all   of   this   pass   on   the 
information to the next level and this guy would fire if at least two of these three inputs are 
funny so that means i have some threshold based on which i decide whether to react or 
not if it is really funny then only i laugh it otherwise i will not laugh 
so the neurons in the brain as was obvious in the previous slide are arranged in a 
hierarchy and i will take a more realistic example where we look at the visual cortex 
so   is   this   is   the   portion   of   the   brain   which   is   responsible   for   processing   visual 
information right so as you see here you have our retina from where the information 
starts flowing and it goes through various levels 
so you see you follow the arrows and you will see there are several levels there is one 
level here then another here another here and so on right so it is again as i was trying 
to illustrate in that cartoon the information is relayed through multiple layers and then it 
goes all the way back to the spinal cord which decides that in this case i need to move 
the muscle right 
so   that   is   what   is   being   decided   here   right   so   the   information   flows   through   a 
hierarchy of layers and in this particular case i am going to focus on these three circled 
layers which are v1 v2 and ait right so these actually form a hierarchy and let us see 
what this hierarchy does right 
so at layer one you detect edges and corners so i am looking at you all i just see some 
dots and some shapes so that is what layer one recognizes i just recognize some edges and 
some dots and so on 
now layer two tries to group all of these together and come up with some meaningful 
feature groups right so it realizes oh these two edges actually form the nose these two 
dots actually form the eyes and these two edges actually form the mouth right so that is 
slightly higher level of processing that it is doing and then layer three further collects all this 
and leads to higher level objects right 
so now it is realizing all these things put together is actually a human face right so you 
add edges and circles or dots  then you had some feature groups and then the feature 
groups combine into objects right so that is how this hierarchy processes 
so here is a disclaimer i understand very little about how the human brain works right 
and what you saw is a very oversimplified explanation of how the brain works right 
what i told you is there is an input a layer of networks which does a network which has 
many layers which does some processing and then you have an output right that is the 
very simplistic view that i gave you this is an oversimplified version but this version 
suffices for everything that we need for this course right this is not a biology or a neural 
processing course right so it is enough for this course so that is where we will end 
module one
