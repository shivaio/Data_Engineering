contours maps 
so we look at something known as contours 
so now visualizing things in 3d can sometimes become a bit difficult especially for the 
person  who  is  making  the  slides  so  we  can  can  we  do  a  2d  visualization  of  this 
traversal have i done this in the ml course no good can we do a 2d visualization of 
this traversal along the error surface 
so for that we need to understand something known as contours how many of you have 
looked at contour diagrams before how many of you know how to read them all of you 
know how to read them 
so let us see now suppose this is what my error surface looks like and i have a single 
scalar  variable  so  this  is  just  a  function  of  w  for  example  and  this  is  what  my  error 
surface looks like 
now what i am going to do is i am going to take horizontal slices on this error surface 
fine  now  can  you  tell  me  how  this  is  going  to  look  from  the  top  sorry  let  me  you 
should  start  answering  before  understand  the  question  this  is  this  error  surface  is 
actually so i was wrong in saying this is theta assume this is w comma b and you are 
just seeing the front view of the error surface what you are seeing here is just the front 
view 
this  error surface is  actually like a dementors hat so right so  imagine that it is a hat 
place like this and you are just seeing the front view of this otherwise a top view does 
not make sense right so now i am going to slice this hat at two vertical positions and 
now you are looking at it from the top what are you going to see 
student ellipsis 
ellipsis everyone agrees with that 
so we will see something like this do  you see  something peculiar about  this  is  this a 
contour map is this no ok and all of you raise your hands when i asked do you know 
contour so do you see something peculiar about this what is it how many if  you get 
that so what  you are seeing here is this portion right where the slope was very steep 
the difference between the two circles or the two ellipses is small and you can visualize it 
if you try to look at it from the top this distance is actually going to be small right and 
in  the  areas  where  the  slope  was  gentle  relatively  gentle  the  distance  is  more  and  you 
can again visualize it right from if you look at from the top this is the distance that you 
are going to see and what do  you say about these guys what does that indicate they 
are the same 
student 
value  across  that  entire  region  the  value  is  same  because  you  have  taken  a  verticals 
you  have  taken  a  horizontal  slice  at  a  particular  vertical  position  right  so  you  have 
taken a horizontal slice at this position that means the error is going to remain the same 
throughout that rim is this clear to everyone ok it is very important that you understand 
this 
so  there  are  only  two  things  that  you  need  to  understand  if  you  want  to  read  contour 
maps one is  a small distance between the contours indicates that the steep slope exists 
along  that  direction  and  a  large  distance  between  the  contours  indicates  that  a  gentle 
slope  exists  along  the  direction  so  everything  today  is  going  to  be  about  steep  and 
gentle slopes and the other thing that you know need to know is that whenever you see 
one circle the error is the same along that circle or ellipse whatever you boundary that 
you  see  the  error  is  the  same  because  you  are  taking  these  vertical  slices  so  we  are 
ready with this rule everyone understands this perfectly 
so  i  will  just  give  you  a  couple  of  exercises  and  you  have  to  tell  me  whether  you 
understand this or not 
so i have plotted a three d surface or two d i have what is this 
student 
no 
student there is a contour 
there is a contour everything is not going to look like clean circles always right ok so 
this is  a contour every line that  you see here represents  one  cut  along the vertical  axis 
right  that  means  the  error  is  the  same  there  now  what  you  are  seeing  is  a  contour  i 
want  you  to  guess  the  three  d  surface  from  this  you  just  guess  it  i  mean  just  keep  it  to 
yourself fine the color is the same right blue is good red is bad 
so blue means the darker the shade of blue the lesser the value of the error the darker 
the  shade  of  red  the  higher  the  value  of  the  error  ok  i  want  you  to  imagine  the  three  d 
surface  if  you  can  do  that  then  i  will  be  sure  that  you  understand  what  how  to  read  a 
contour how many if we can imagine this you can just say yes right i can never figure 
out whether you actually speak it 
so  let  me  help  you  with  the  first  one  and  then  we  will  do  a  few  more  so  let  us  start 
with the extremes right so let me see how to do this so this portion i also need to do it 
for the video ok so let me just do it here so this portion what do you think about the 
slope there very  flattish  why because this is  the line that  you see  and the other line is 
not even in the figure right so it is basically very flat the slope is very gentle is it a 
low region or a high region high region fine ok now what is actually happening here 
what is the slope here 
student high 
very high that is why these two regions are very close to each other so from this high 
region  what  is  happening  suddenly  there  is  a  slope  and  you  are  going  down  and  you 
know you are going down because you are reaching a blue region right ok now what is 
happening here 
student very flat 
very flat and this also flat but slightly upper than the lower guy is that fine now can 
you all imagine this ok and is this what you thought it is perfectly yes right is exactly 
what you thought ok just a minute so the orientation here has been changed a bit right 
so this portion actually corresponds to this portion are the two this is clear this portion 
corresponds to this portion right the just orientated fine 
so  you  start  off  this  high  plateau  region  which  is  here  then  you  start  going  down  go 
down and then you see a fold here right that is this fold so you went to a darker shade 
and then you came up to a slightly lighter shade the shades are ok 
guess  the 3d surfaces  how many if  you want  to  play  this forever now start  with  the 
extremes the bad guys the good  guys the plateaus and the valleys and then see how do 
you go from the plateau to the valley ok tell me the corners first this plateau or valley 
student plateau 
plateau this plateau higher than this or lower than this 
student lower than this 
lower than this this 
student valley 
this  towards  the  valley  it  is  still  between  red  and  blue  right  it  is  not  like  right  down 
there and what happens to all these guys all are very steep slows all converging down 
into the valley so can you perfectly imagine this 
and you will tell yes when i say when i show you the three d surface right again you need 
to reorient yourself so this corner here is this corner this corner here is this corner so 
we  had  these  two  plateaus  at  the  top  we  had  this  slightly  higher  valley  slightly  lower 
valley  and  then  all  of  them  going  into  a  very  deep  valley  you  see  that  everyone  gets 
this how many  if  you  have a problem  with  this  if  you have a problem  with  this  you 
will  just  sleep  off  in  the  rest  of  the  lecture  so  i  want  you  all  to  understand  this  very 
carefully i do not mind repeating it how many of you understand this you understand 
the regions with gentle slope 
student yes 
the regions where you have a steep slope and you end up into that valley which is the 
valley here can you point it out fine ok so we will move ahead 
so now we know what contour maps are and how to visualize them and so on right so 
now we will try to see the gradient a descent algorithm instead of running it on the 3d 
error surface we will try to run on this 2d contour map 
so this is what i already showed you right i started from here and i showed you how it 
comes here or something like this right that was the gradient descent let me just erase 
this ok that is something like what the gradient descent algorithm 
now  again  you  just  need  to  reorient  yourself  so  let  us  see  this  corner  is  this  corner 
this  corner  is  this  corner  and  so  on  right  so  you  get  the  reorientation  right  it  just 
shifted now i am going to start my gradient descent algorithm from here from this point 
ok everyone see is that ok i am going to start from there and you have to help me and i 
am not going to just keep clicking you have to tell me what is going to happen so what 
will happen initially fast movement slow movement 
student slow movement 
slow  movement  right  so  i  am  running  it  one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  it  just  keeps  running  very 
slowly now what will happen 
student fast 
fast ok now you see actually you can see the arrows these arrows are the quantity the 
magnitude of the movement right so earlier this movement was so small that you could 
not even see the arrows i have been drawing arrows right from the beginning but  you 
could  not  see  them  at  the  beginning  now  you  can  see  them  right  now  what  will 
happen 
student slow 
slow right so you see the exact same movement that i did on the three d surface now you 
can visualize it on the two d surface right and you can easily tell me where it will go fast 
where it will go slow right and where it will just keep moving very drag its feet and so on 
ok  so  this  is  where  it  starts  dragging  its  feet  and  the  same  thing  happened  when  we 
were  in  this  region  right  so  just  you  just  make  the  connection  that  we  are  in  the 
corresponding three d region there ok fine so we are moving very  slow and it just keeps 
running 
so that is where we lend this module so we just revised gradient descent we saw that 
things are proportional to the gradient  that is why gradient descent and the smaller the 
gradient  the  slower  the  movement  the  larger  the  gradient  higher  the  movement  gentle 
the slope 
student smaller 
smaller the gradient steeper the slope larger the gradient
