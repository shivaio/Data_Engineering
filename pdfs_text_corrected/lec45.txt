principal component analysis and it is interpretations 
so  in  this  module  we  will  talk  about  principle  component  analysis  and  it  is  different 
interpretations in this model we will look at one interpretation and then in the rest of the 
module some other interpretations 
so the story i add is going to be this we will talk about pca and it is interpretations ok 
so  now  let  us  try  to  motivate  pca  first  consider  the  following  data  ok  in  what 
dimension is this data 
student two dimension 
two  dimensions  it  is  r  two  ok  and  each  point  here  is  represented  as  it  is  x  coordinate  and 
using it is x coordinate and it is y coordinate ok now it means that were using x and y as 
the basis  right  that  is clear that is  the standard way that  you would do any data point 
you will just represent using that basis 
now what if we choose a different basis let me give you one basis and then let me ask 
you some questions on this 
suppose we chose this basis so in the previous modules we made a case for the x and y 
coordinate  axis  there  is  nothing  sacrosanct  about  it  you  could  use  any  basis  the  only 
condition on the basis that the vector should be linearly independent and in fact if they 
are orthogonal it is even better right 
so now i have given you a different basis now what do you make any observation here 
so they have all the points here have a very small component along the u two axis  right 
so now this so far this point right if i consider at this point then this is the component 
along the u one axis so that is it is u one coordinate as akin to the x coordinate and this is it 
is u two coordinate akin to the y coordinate is a are the arrows clear here 
so that means there u two coordinate is very small and it is also very small for all the data 
points right so it is almost as if there is some noise there it is all within some epsilon 
now  so  it  seems  that  the  data  which  were  actually  represented  in  r  two  can  actually  be 
represented in r one by getting rid of this noisy dimension right so if you had chosen a 
different  basis  you  realize  that  with  just  one  dimension  you  could  have  captured 
everything  that  was  there  in  the  data  and  the  other  dimension  was  just  adding  noise  it 
was redundant there is hardly any information there 
so now can you state this more formally because this is this intuition but can you stated 
more  formally  in  terms  of  things  that  you  have  learned  and  say  probability  for  it  for 
example what is wrong with the direction u two the spread of the data points along the u 
two direction is very small what is the spread mean the variance right so we do not care 
about u two because the variance in the data along this direction is very very small ok and 
in  particular  right  if  i  were  to  build  a  classifier  then  would  u  two  have  any  predictive 
power because along this dimension the points are indistinguishable ok so think of it 
that  you are trying to  find out whether  you have so  you have say one hundred  candidates and 
you want to decide whether they would be good basketball players or not 
and quite naturally all the people that have shown up are say six foot two and six foot three inch 
and so on and there in a very small height difference between them and all of them are 
sixty-two is the average and very close the spread is not much so this feature is not going to 
help you decide whether this person is going to be a good basketball player or not you 
will  have  to  rely  on  other  features  where  the  variance  is  more  for  example  how  many 
teams  has  he  participated  in  the  past  how  many  matches  as  he  won  as  a  team  as  a 
member of some team and so on it 
so  those  who  expect  some  spread  to  be  there  all  these  one hundred  candidates  might  have 
different things right but if the height is the same for all of them it is not going to be a 
good predictor and that is exactly what is happening along the u two direction the points 
are almost indistinguishable there that is why it does not matter 
so in general given any data now this was a simple case where the data was r two i am 
talking about the general case where the data is rn right and you will find this situation 
in higher dimensions also so you would not want to use that entire n dimensional data 
where you know that there are some columns along with the variance is very small so 
you  want  to  represent  the  data  with  fewer  dimensions  such  that  the  data  has  high 
variance along those dimensions 
now  let  me  just  clear  a  confusion  here  right  so  i  am  not  saying  that  take  your  n 
dimensional data ok find the variance across each of these dimensions and then throw 
away the columns which have the lowest dimension in this particular example if you had 
done  this  what  would  happen  could  you  have  done  that  think  of  the  original 
dimensions  x  and  y  along  these  two  dimensions  there  is  enough  various  in  the  data 
right  the  x  coordinates  vary  from  here  to  here  and  the  y  coordinates  also  vary  from 
this  point  right  up  to  that  point  right  so  there  is  enough  spread  in  the  x  and  y 
coordinates 
so in your original data i am not saying that pick look at each column and see if there is 
no  variance  along  that  column  then  throw  it  away  that  would  not  work  because  you 
might  end  up  with  the  situation  that  there  is  enough  variance  across  each  of  these 
dimensions it is just that when you look at the data from a different angle that means 
you projected onto a different basis this becomes clear right 
so you see the difference i that is not the same these two things are different operations 
so what i am looking at is projecting the data to a different basis that is exactly what i 
did  with  u  one  and  u  two  and  then  some  things  became  clear  about  the  data  now  this 
projection along a different basis i would be interested in doing that only if i can get rid 
of  the  number  of  dimensions  right  if  now  i  had  already  had  one  basis  where  i  had  n 
dimensions now if the new basis is also going to be that all these new n dimensions that 
i  have  come  up  with  are  important  then  you  are  not  gaining  much  i  do  still  have  this 
high dimensional  data but  you would like to  project  it in  a way that  you get  rid of  the 
lower variance dimensions 
so  you  might  project  it  onto  n  dimensions  but  you  want  to  rank  these  dimensions 
according to variance and then throw away some of these dimensions is that clear is the 
objective  clear  ok  fine  is  that  all  that  we  care  about  n  dimensions’  project  to  a  new 
basis and throw away the key dimensions which have less variance is that all what else 
would you want people have done the mlpr course no i would not so i am not going 
to classification or anything i just want a better representation of the data at this point i 
am not really thinking about what  i want to do with the data maybe  you are talking in 
terms  of  classification  and  we  have  already  seen  even  if  the  data  is  not  linearly 
separable we have solutions for dealing with right so that is not a critical point ok so 
there is something else that very interested in and let us look at that 
now consider this data i have three dimensional data ok do you find something odd about 
this data 
student 
y and z are 
student 
are highly dash 
student correlated 
correlated  right  do  you  want  these  dimensions  can  you  think  of  any  practice  such 
dimensions occurring height in  centimeter  and height  in  inches  someone would have 
just  given  you  data  right  or  if  you  if  you  take  the  credit  card  a  credit  card  fraud 
detection case right someone would give you the salary and it would also give you the 
income tax now these two are highly correlated right 
so then you do not really care if you have one you could probably almost with certainty 
predict the other right modulus some rules right because you get some tax exemptions 
and all that but still so you can have this in practice but  even in our oil mining case 
your salinity pressure density those things could be related right so z is not adding any 
new  information  beyond  what  y  is  happening  so  the  two  columns  are  highly  correlated 
so  actually  yeah  this  is  the  formula  for  correlation  all  of  you  know  this  anyone  who 
does not know this formula good so not nothing is a stupid question right so you can 
always ask 
so y hat is the mean of this column ok sorry y bar z bar is the mean of this column and 
this is how you compute correlation this is just the formula ok so from every entry you 
subtract  the  mean  ok  so  this  is  known  as  centering  the  data  so  if  you  do  this  what 
would the mean of the new data be 
student zero 
zero right so that is why it is called centering the data ok so i will have zero mean zero mean 
and  you  so  what  does  this  what  is  the  intuition  behind  this  formula  does  anyone 
know can anyone tell me so this is a summation ok so this quantity is going to be 
high if the summation is high it is a summation of some n terms now these terms could 
be positive or negative if all the terms are positive what would we happen to the sum 
student 
it would be high if there are some terms which are negative it would be low now when 
would all the terms be positive whenever y is above the mean z is also above the mean 
right  therefore  this  quantity  is  positive  this  quantity  is  positive  whenever  both  are 
below  the  mean  again  the  product  would  be  positive  when  one  is  above  the  mean  the 
other is below the mean then there is something wrong happening right and in that case 
you will have a negative term right 
so for more details of course you can refer your other textbooks and so on but this is 
just the intuition an important  step here is  to  zero mean the data  right we are computing 
the subtracting the mean of the data ok another way of saying this is that the column z 
is  actually linearly dependent  on  y ok  it  is  almost  linearly dependent  i  of course have 
some noise twenty-one seventy-six and so on but it is largely linearly dependent i can get i can write z 
as some c times x fine ok 
so  now  can  you  tell  me  the  refined  goals  that  we  have  we  are  interesting  the 
representing  data  using  fewer  dimensions  such  that  remember  that  when  i  say  fewer 
dimensions  i  mean  a  new  set  of  dimensions  right  it  is  not  throwing  away  dimensions 
from  the  current  data  we  are  looking  for  a  new  set  of  dimensions  what  are  the 
conditions that we want from these new set of dimensions 
student 
one there should be high variance along these dimensions the new dimensions and 
student 
the dependence are linearly independent or uncorrelated ok fine 
and even better of course if they are orthogonal why 
student 
because we are looking for a new dash 
student basis 
basis and the most convenient basis is 
student orthogonal basis 
orthogonal basis ok fine 
so now let us assume someone has given us this new basis ok and let us call this p one p 
two pm so instead of this x y z and so on someone has given us this new basis eventually 
we will of course figure out how to find the basis but let us assume that someone has 
given  this  new  basis  right  and  they  are  both  linearly  independent  and  actually  it  is 
redundant  actually  so  yeah  this  example  of  a  redundant  feature  such  an  orthogonal 
vectors is sufficient they are linearly independent 
let p be an n cross n matrix such that p one p two p n are the columns of p right same thing 
as we had put the eigen vectors in a column and probably i have unknowingly given out 
the solution but ok and let x one to xm be the m data points given to us ok so we are 
given this data as usual we have this x matrix each one of them belongs to rn and we 
have  m  such  data  points  right  that  is  the  standard  thing  that  we  are  operating  and  you 
always write this as a matrix ok and we have already done the data is  zero mean and unit 
variance 
actually unit variance is not required but the data is zero mean fine that we will sorry i am 
going to deal with covariance as a unit variance is not required so the data is zero mean is 
what i am going to assume but what if the data is nonzero mean i can always make it zero 
mean right 
so just to remember this is an important trick that you will always have to use whenever 
you  are  doing  any  large  scale  machine  learning  so  whenever  you  are  participating  in 
kaggle competitions almost the first thing that you do is standardize the data that means 
make it zero mean and unit variance so why is that important 
student scaling 
right scaling issues would not be there right so if i have something in centimeters and 
some  other  unit  in  kilometers  right  now  remember  that  always  you  are  doing 
somewhere this linear operation w transpose x you might add a nonlinearity on top of 
that but now if your xi dimensions some of them are in the range of zero to ten thousand some of 
them are in the range zero to ten right 
then  there  is  some  abnormality  here  right  some  dimensions  are  winnings  in  terms  of 
their magnitude and some dimensions are losing out right that is why you always make 
it unit variance and you also make it zero mean you center the data ok so we will assume 
this and if we all understand if the data is already not zero mean and unit variance we can 
always make it zero mean and unit variance just scale it and make it centered 
now we want to represent each xi right so xi is one of these data points that we had 
that  means  one  of  the  rows  of  our  matrix  ok  and  you  want  to  write  it  as  a  linear 
combination of this new basis 
so if you have any basis any vector you can write it as a linear combination of that basis 
is it fine so far it is ok ok now for an orthogonal basis we know that we can compute 
these  alphas  just  by  taking  a  dot  product  of  the  vector  with  the  dimension  ok  and  just 
repeating some of the things right 
so  now  let  us  see  what  this  means  for  one  of  the  dimensions  this  is  my  data  point  xi 
which i want to transform ok for one of the dimensions i just had to take the dot product 
with that dimension and this will give me how many values one value that means the 
coordinate  along  p  one  i  want  to  do  it  for  all  the  n  of  them  i  can  write  it  as  this  vector 
matrix multiplication right what is the dimension of this 
n cross one how many if you get that ok so this oh not many why 
student 
one cross n fine that is fine yeah how many of you get this ok fine yeah so this will give 
me all the n alphas is that clear for this data point 
so it will give me alpha i one to alpha i is it 
now i want to do this for the entire data right so i have done it for x one i also want it to 
be  done  for  x  two  and  all  the  way  up  to  x  m  for  each  of  these  i  would  have  such  an 
operation where i have a vector multiplied by this matrix if i just stack all these vectors 
i get back my matrix x and the whole operation i can write as x into p ok is that clear to 
everyone ok what is the dimension of x into p 
student m cross n 
m cross 
student n 
n right so for all the m data points i have alpha 1to alpha n is that clear anyone who does 
not understand this 
so  x  hat  is  the  matrix  of  the  transformed  points  is  that  clear  i  have  now  the  new 
coordinates  instead  of  the  original  coordinates  according  to  the  coordinate  axis  i  have 
the new coordinates in this matrix 
now i will just go through some very simple theorems or rather results and i will not 
prove them you can prove them on your own or other proof is there in the slides we can 
look at it later on right so if x is a matrix such that it columns have zero mean and if x 
hat is equal to xp then the columns of x hat will also have zero mean is this obvious to 
most of you not really is it how many of you think it is obvious ok then let me just go 
over the proof 
so for any matrix a one transpose a right  so  that means  you have this vector this is  a 
vector  or  a  matrix  yeah  this  is  a  vector  right  so  i  have  a  vector  of  n  one  so  one  this  is 
nothing but a vector of n 1s so what is this product actually going to give me 
it will give me a vector containing n elements what is each element 
student sum of that column 
sum of that column right is this fine ok this is very obvious to see from if i have this 
suppose i have two three one and three six seven ok and then of course the corresponding 
so if i do this multiplication i will get a two dimensional output which would be just seven and 
sixteen right so that is just the sum of that column 
student 
so  now  we  have  this  x  hat  that  is  the  transform  matrix  now  let  us  see  if  i  do  this 
operation i x hat what happen i can write it as this i can club it as this what is this it 
will be all 0s because the original matrix was mean zero that means the of the elements of 
all  the  columns  each  column  independently  was  zero  that  what  this  is  going  to  be  a  zero 
vector  so  zero  vector  multiplied  by  any  matrix  is  going  to  be  zero  now  is  it  obvious  i 
hope this is obvious x transpose x is a symmetric matrix i still have the proof for that 
now if x is a matrix whose columns are zero mean then a matrix sigma which i am going 
to  call as a covariance  matrix which is  given by  this is  actually the covariance matrix 
how  many  of  you  agree  with  this  how  many  of  you  have  seen  the  covariance  matrix 
before so all of you agree that this is the covariance matrix if you do not please raise 
your hands if you do not you will not understand the rest of the stuff now you have to be 
given the right incentives 
so let us see be the covariance matrix of x now what is the covariance matrix actually 
first of all tell me that if i say that i have an n cross n matrix x 
let me not make it any cross n let me make it m cross n ok what does the covariance 
matrix actually capture what is the dimension of the covariance matrix first of all 
student n cross n 
n cross n ok and what does each entry of the covariance matrix capture the covariance 
between the i’th column and the j’th column 
student 
so the entry ij of the covariance matrix captures the covariance between the i’th column 
and the j’th column is that fine now what is the formula for covariance suppose i give 
you two columns right let us see i have give you x one one x one two x one three and x two one x two two x two three can 
you give me a formula and of course i will go up to k or rather m 
so what is the formula summation 
student 
i equal to one to 
student m 
m 
student 
mu one 
student 
mu two anything missing 
student by m 
by m anything else in the denominator no no is it fine ok so an what is mu one mu one 
is  just  an  average  of  this  ok  so  this  is  the  covariance  formula  now  if  the  mu’s  are  zero 
then what does this boil down to 
student 
x one i into x two i  what is this quantity actually 
student 
this is the dot product between the i’th column and the j’th column fine ok now that is 
pretty much the explanation right so now the c ij’th entry is supposed to be given by 
this formula  if the means are zero  you are just left  with  this formula and this is  nothing 
but the dot product between the i’th row and the j’th i mean the i’th column and the j’th 
column is that fine 
and now if you write it as a matrix then you can just say that it is the ij’th entry of the x 
transpose x matrix everyone gets this no one has any confusion the people who raised 
their hands fine good 
so we now this is where the we are so far that we have assumed that someone has given 
us these dimensions’ p one to pn which we have put in the matrix p  right and we have 
also  made  a  case  that  x  into  p  which  is  what  i  have  written  here  actually  is  just  a 
projection of the original data onto this new basis right everyone gets that ok and i am 
calling  that  new  projection  or  the  new  result  that  i  get  as  x  hat  so  that  is  what  my 
transform data is 
what is missing here 
student 
we do not know what p is that i am assuming someone has given me that p now i need 
to figure out what is the p here now using the previous definition we get that this is the 
covariance matrix of the transform data so let us just write that this is fine this is fine 
what is this 
student 
covariance matrix of the original data ok so i will just write it as sigma fine ok now 
each cell ij of the covariance matrix towards the covariance between columns i and j of 
x hat where x hat is the transformed data what is the property that you want to hold i 
give you two conditions or i will give you only one condition for now when i is not equal to 
j 
student 
zero ok so what should the covariance matrix look like 
student 
remember that this is what is this this is the covariance matrix of the transformed data 
right that is what  i started with  right this is the covariance matrix of this transformed 
data what do i want this covariance matrix to look like 
student diagonal matrix 
a diagonal matrix ok because i want every non diagonal element to be zero right and this 
point i am not telling you what i want the diagonal elements to be i am just telling you i 
do not want them to be zero 
well if it is zero what would that mean 
student 
that is the variance right if you take the along a diagonal what you get is the variance it 
is if it is not clear right now well return back to that right now we just know that the off 
diagonal elements are the covariance between the i’th and j’th column and we want that 
to  be  zero  so  we  want  this  condition  to  hold  this  is  something  very  new  that  you  have 
never  seen  in  this  course  before  they  have  actually  not  seen  in  this  course  before  have 
you seen this or not 
student 
thank god fine 
so what is this 
student diagonalization 
the diagonalization of which matrix this matrix right and what was this matrix it was 
x transpose x this is clear so what is the solution all rows always lead to 
student eigenvectors 
eigenvectors right 
so we want p transpose sigma p to be a diagonal matrix and we know which are the set 
of vectors which i put in p such that they will diagonalize sigma 
student eigenvectors 
eigenvectors of 
student 
x transpose x right ok wait why did i put this it is the matrix of the eigenvectors right 
so it is a matrix of the eigenvectors of x transpose x 
so  now  have  we  finished  it  do  we  know  principal  component  analysis  now  so  we 
started with the intuition that we wanted to transform the data ok i cannot stress enough 
that we want to transform the data not chopped off dimensions from the existing data ok 
that means we need to project the data to a new basis and we had a couple of conditions 
the  variance  should  be  high  and  the  covariance  should  be  zero  we  have  satisfied  one 
condition  which is  the covariance is  zero and we  arrive  at  a solution  which says that  the 
eigenvectors forms the basis that you should project on so that the covariance would be 
zero 
so we have a solution we know exactly which basis to use to represent the data ok so 
that  the  covariance  condition  is  satisfied  what  about  the  variance  did  we  do  anything 
about the variance 
student 
so we will come back to that ok fine 
why is this a good basis what does the what is a good basis the best basis 
student orthogonal 
orthogonal right because the eigenvalues of x transpose x are linearly independent that 
ok and they are also orthogonal because x transpose x is a dash matrix 
student 
ok 
good real symmetric 
so this method is called the principle component analysis for transforming a data to a 
new  basis  and  that  where  the  dimensions  are  nonredundant  because  they  have  low 
covariance and not  noisy because they have high  variance the second  part  i have not 
proved right  and  i will get  to  that at  some point fine no that is  what  we saw right  no 
what is i did not get that now in practice how many eigenvectors would you have 
student n eigenvector 
n eigenvectors do you want to keep all of them which ones will you throw away 
student 
the low variance ok 
and now in the next interpretation actually we will try to see what is the what happens 
when  you throw  away the least  important  dimensions right what  do  you mean by  the 
least important dimensions
