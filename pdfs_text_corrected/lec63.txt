parameter sharing and tying 
the  next  thing  that  i would  like  to  talk  about  and  this  quickly go  over  this  parameter 
sharing and tying 
 
so  parameter  sharing  and  tying  i  will  just  quickly  go  on  this  because  for  the  sake  of 
completeness it is there in this lecture but it should it would really make sense when i 
do convolutional neural networks so for the time being just take my word for it that in 
convolutional  neural  networks  you  do  a  lot  of  parameter  sharing  where  as  the  other 
place that you have seen parameter tying so that is again something that i am not going 
to talk about 
so  this  is  typically  used  in  auto  encoders  where  the  encoder  and  decoder  weights  are 
shared  and  that  effectively  reduces  the  number  of  parameters  in  the  model  which 
effectively  reduces  the  complexity  on  the  model  if  the  complexity  of  the  model  goes 
down  omega  theta  goes  down  because  that  is  what  which  wise  man  told  us  that  time
