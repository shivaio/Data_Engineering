linearly separable boolean functions 
so in this module we look at linearly separable boolean functions again and we will 
try to make some more statements about them 
so what do we have do so the guiding question that we have is what do we do about 
functions which are not linearly separable and let us see one such very simple function 
can you guess what function i am going to talk about all of you are paying attention in 
the first lecture 
so here is the xor function now these are the set of inequalities that result from xor 
function i hope right now let us see the first condition implies that w naught should be 
less than zero second condition implies this third condition implies this fourth condition 
implies this just looking at this can you tell me can you find a configuration for w 
naught w1 w2 such that these inequalities can be satisfied together no right because two 
and three want it to be greater than minus one minus w naught and when you take an addition 
of that it has to be less than minus one 
so that is not going to happen so you see a contradiction so this is a simple boolean 
function which the perceptron cannot handle because it is not linearly separable it is not 
linearly separable there does not exist a line if there does not exist a line you cannot 
find the line in fact you can look at it visually 
so these are the red points for which the output should be zero or one and the blue points are 
the points for which the output should be zero if we need to change this i think we were 
using blue as positive and red as negative and you cannot just draw a line there is no 
way you can draw a line such that the blue points lie on one side and the red points lie on 
the other side so it is a simple two input function so it is not that i have taken a very 
contrived example 
most real world data is not linearly separable and it always contains some outliers right 
so here maybe you have some data where you are trying to say that people which live in 
this part of the world belong to a certain or maybe people who live or work here have a 
certain qualification people who work in this company may have a certain different 
qualification and there might be some outliers right it is not that is always going be 
very clean so now what do i mean and it is not necessary that the points will only be 
outliers 
in fact there could be a clear case where there are no outliers but still you cannot find a 
line such that you separate the positive from the negative can you think of such an 
example good right this is clear data there is no outliers here as well i mean it is just 
saying that everyone who lies within this boundary has a certain characteristic and 
outside that boundary people have a different characteristic right and there is no outlier 
here but you cannot separate this data with a line so all functions that you deal with 
will not go or are not going to be linearly separable 
so we have to work around those right and while a single perceptron cannot deal with 
this we will show that a network of perceptronâ€™s can indeed deal with such data so that 
is where we are headed 
so before going there we will discuss some more boolean functions in more detail and 
i will try to see what kind of nonlinearly separable boolean functions are there 
so first of all how many boolean functions can you design from two inputs how many 
can you design sixteen looks like a good number from three inputs two hundred and fifty-six how many if you 
understand this let us see so let us begin with some easy ones that you already know 
right so these are two inputs x1 x2 what is this function always off the other 
extreme is always on and i have already given you the answer f sixteen 
so then you have the and function and or function then some other functions right 
so why did you reach sixteen actually because with two inputs we will have these four 
values to take care of and each of these are again binary so you actually have two raise to 
two raise to n right so for three inputs two raise to two raise to three would be two hundred and fifty-six now that is 
the easy part of these how many are linearly separable i will have to do any actually 
stare it in and seriously try to find the answer when you cannot really do that 
so turns out all of them except xor and in not of xor ok so for the two input cases 
there   are   two   functions   which   are   not   linearly   separable   for   n   inputs   how   many 
functions would be not linearly separable it is an arbitrary n is not the answer you are 
not going to disappoint me not n ok but what is the answer so for n inputs we will 
have two raise two n functions of these we do not know how many are going to be not 
linearly separable that is not a solved problem although i encourage you to go and find 
the answer 
i am looking for a good will hunting kind of a moment but all it suffices to know is that 
there exists some which are not linearly separable and that everyone agrees that there 
exists some right and as n grows probably that number will increase and so on but it is 
not known exactly you cannot write it as a function so what we have done so far is 
looked at boolean functions how many boolean functions can exist and of that we just 
have concluded that there would be some which are not linearly separable
