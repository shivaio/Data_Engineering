so this was all happening where deep learning now started showing a lot of promise in a 
lot of fields nlp vision speech and again this deep reinforcement learning and so on 
which led to this complete madness starting from two thousand and thirteen 
well almost for every application the traditional methods were then overwritten or kind 
of beaten by deep neural network based system so something like language modelling 
which has been around since probably 1950s or so 
now the reining algorithm or the better algorithm for language modelling  is now 
something which is based on deep neural networks 
then similarly for speech recognition lot of work a lot of probabilistic lot of work 
based on probabilistic models was done in this or in the speech area or the speech 
literature for the past thirty forty years and now all of that has been overcome by deep neural 
network based solutions 
same for machine translation a lot of interest in this field a lot of companies now have 
their machine translation systems based on deep neural networks as opposed to the 
earlier phrase based statistical machine translations or the probabilistic models which 
were used earlier 
similarly for conversation modelling dialogue a lot of new work started in dialogue post 
a deep learning era where people now realize that if you have a lot of sequences of 
conversations you could actually try to train a deep neural network to learn from this 
sequence and have conversations with humans of course you are nowhere close to 
human level conversations we are very very far off from them but in limited domains 
these bots are showing some success now 
same for question answering where you are given a question and you want to answer it 
either from a knowledge graph or from a document or from a image and so on 
and in the field of computer vision things like object detection most of the reigning 
systems   or   the   best   performing   systems   nowadays   are   deep   neural   network   based 
systems a lot of advances are being made on these systems over in the last few years 
same for visual tracking where you want to track the same person in a video or image 
captioning where you want to generate captions for images for example people upload 
a lot of images on facebook 
and if you want to automatically caption them or imagine you are on a reselling site 
right something like olx where you upload your furniture and you do not provide a 
description from that but can the machine already automatically generate a description 
for it so it is easier for the human to read what that product is and so on 
so similarly video captioning i given a video anyone to caption the main activity which 
is happening in that video all of these problems are being solved using deep learning 
based solutions using a combination  of something known as feed forward neural 
networks or convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks and so on 
visual question answering you are given an image and a question and you want to 
answer that question 
video question answering answering questions from videos 
video summarizations if you are given a large video and you want to generate a trailer a 
sort of a trailer for that video contains which kind is the most important frame for that 
video even these systems are based on deep learning 
then this was all about classification recognition and so on  but  now people started 
getting more ambitious that can we humans are very good at creativity so can we use 
machines to be creative right to generate images  so now  if i have seen a lot of 
celebrity faces  can i generate new celebrity faces or if i have seen a lot of bedroom 
images 
and i am if a fireman architect now can i generate new bedroom images can i can we 
train a machine to generate new bed bedroom images so a lot of phenomenal progress 
or work has happened in this field in the last four five years starting with things like 
generative adversarial networks variational autoencoders and so on 
and   people   are   now   starting   to   seriously   invest   into   creativity   that   how   to   make 
machines creative again we are far off from where the desired output but there is still 
significant progress happening in this field generating audio 
so that was about generating images you can generate music also 
and this is again about generating images and so on
