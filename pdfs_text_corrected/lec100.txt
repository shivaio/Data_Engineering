so  we  will  start  so  we  were  in  the  3rd  lecture  on  cnnâ€™s  where  we  were  looking  at 
different visualization tools for understanding what your convolutional neural network is 
learning and we did a bunch of things and now you move on to the next module where 
we talk about something known as deep dream  very interestingly titled but  i am sure 
most of you have already seen this or read about this 
so here is the idea right so far we were seeing that if we start from a blank image then 
we could suitably modify it by constructing an optimization problem whose parameters 
are the pixels of the image and we can modify the image so that it starts looking like a 
certain class of interest right but now suppose instead of starting with a blank image i 
start with a natural image right say a sky or any image that you have in your dataset 
i  start  with  this  and  then  i  focus  on  neurons  in  some  layer  of  the  convolutional  neural 
network i am focusing on these neurons say any one of these neurons i am focusing on 
and i want to change the image so that these neurons so when i say neurons i actually 
mean only a single neuron but for illustration i will show multiple neurons so i want to 
change the image so that  this neuron fires even  more so how would we achieve this 
what will we do 
so say this is  the neuron which  i want  to  fire even more  so what  is  my  optimization 
problem first of all what are the parameters of the optimization problem 
student 
the pixels of the image that is clear now i want this to fire even more so what is the 
objective function what  you are  going to  maximize lets  call this neuron as hij what 
you are going to maximize 
student 
sorry 
student no 
no i want this neuron to fire more 
student 
maximize hij right i mean that is i mean why so that sort of a thing ok 
but of course we will do something so that it is a neat differentiable thing and so on so 
you want to maximize the activation of one such neuron hij so we could just formulate 
the following optimization problem that  i want to maximize hij 
two ok and of course the 
parameters  of  the  optimization  are  the  image  pixels  and  if  i  consider  one  such  pixel  in 
the image then i essentially need to compute this gradient 
the gradient of the loss function which is hij 
two with respect to this image pixel and i can 
do it in  these two parts the lead ability of the  loss  function with  respect  to  hij and the 
derivative of the hij with  respect  to  the image pixel  this  we have seen  a million  times 
while doing back propagation of course  you are not  gone all the way back to  imn but 
we  saw  last  time  that  it  is  just  one  more  term  in  the  chain  rule  and  this  again  looks 
straightforward right the derivative of the loss function with respect to hij looks straight 
forward so  i have a very simple way of computing the derivative of the loss function 
with respect to any pixel of the image 
so now i can apply gradient descent and i can update the image so i started and now 
remember  that  the  my  original  i  mn  was  not  blank  or  random  or  zero  or  anything  it  is 
actually the sky image so maybe it was blue or cloudy or whatever pixel that i have in 
my original image and that pixel i am changing 
so i have started with the sky image i have changed a bit based on this gradient update 
rule  gradient  descent  update  rule  and  now  i  feed  it  back  to  the  network  what  will 
happen what will happen to hij 
student fire a bit 
it  will  fire  a  bit  more  because  that  is  exactly  how  you  have  changed  the  image  with 
exactly that objective function right 
and  now  if  i  keep  doing  this  what  will  happen  so  remember  what  does  h  ij  actually 
capture now this is where so if you understand this right you will really understand and 
appreciate  everything  about  convolutional  neural  network  and  i  will  be  sure  that  you 
are actually understood the details and not just these boxed architectures right so what 
if this happens right then what does actually hij capture it captures certain 
student patterns 
patterns in the image right now if hij is firing that means these patterns have started 
student 
appearing in the image we started with a sky image 
and  now  hij  is  firing  more  and  more  that  means  it  is  now  the  image  is  suddenly 
becoming  more  and  more  or  containing  more  and  more  patterns  for  which  h  ij  should 
fire does that make sense ok yeah so let us run this algorithm we will start with this 
image and we will run this algorithm so i will run it before that i want some guesses 
what kind of patterns do you think will start appearing here and this is deep dream is the 
title right ok so fine 
so let us see so i will run this algorithm so what  i am doing is  i am starting with this 
image  and  running  exactly  what  i  showed  you  that  i  will  compute  the  gradient  with 
respect  to  one  of  the  neurons  and  i  will  keep  updating  the  image  so  that  it  becomes 
more and more like the patterns that i am trying to capture so lets run this and observe 
carefully it is almost a magic trick i hope this does not disappoint what do you see 
student 
most of them are what 
student 
they  are  dreaming  so  they  are  literally  building  castles  in  the  air  right  so  what  is 
happening  why  is  this  happening  everyone  sees  castles  right  that  is  the  first  thing 
otherwise 
student [laughter] 
ok good why is this happening have you seen the disney logo the castle what does it 
have in back background how many of you find this interesting how many think this is 
ok  expected  ok  why  is  this  happening  think  about  training  data  think  about  what 
would have happen or you missed the magic show so what is the convolutional neural 
network actually trying to do 
student 
i will give you a hint its being over enthusiastic how many of you get that ok so here 
is  what  is  happening  right  should  i  explain  it  or  no  i  am  not  going  to  ask  you  a  quiz 
question i am just saying that i have some more images to show ok i will explain it first 
so this is what is happening right 
so  in  the  training  data  whenever  the  castle  appears  it  is  typically  has  the  sky  as  the 
background  ok  so  now  the  convolutional  neural  network  started  drawing  these 
correlations  so  whenever  it  sees  a  sky  it  is  trying  to  find  a  castle  somewhere  but 
because  it  knows  that  most  of  the  times  whenever  i  see  a  sky  there  is  a  castle  in  the 
foreground 
so those neurons are firing a bit and then now you are trying to fire them even more and 
more  so  that  keep  trying  to  change  the  image  till  this  castle  actually  appears  on  the 
image how do you how many if you get this explanation please raise your hands ok 
so let us see some more examples right so now guess what will happen here ships ok 
again a generation which thinks of 
student 
a ships is ok i shouldnt comment on that 
student birds 
fishes 
student birds 
birds what else but there are also mountains 
student 
ice ok interesting 
student 
now  our  expectations  are  increase  let  me  just  run  this  and  see  what  happens  oops  oh 
no 
student 
i have my final trick ok 
student [laughter] 
the prestige is gone ok yeah so what do you see here so actually if you go back and 
look at it carefully right this is very interesting a lot of fish eyes actually start appearing 
here  and  some  shapes  like  fishes  actually  start  appearing  here  go  back  and  look  at  it 
carefully and all on the mountains and the green regions a lot of birds and animals start 
appearing right which is again expected because in your data set  you would have seen 
birds and animals with a green or this kind of a background right whatever you call it a 
mix of green and brown background right 
so  now  it  is  trying  to  find  those  things  even  though  they  do  not  exist  and  as  it  try  to 
force it more and more it starts creating those images as you start asking to dream more 
and  more  right  and  since  this  is  about  dreams  i  could  not  let  this  go  it  has  to  had 
inception in that so what will happen here now 
student 
there is actually nothing interesting is this for my own sake that i put this unfortunately 
nothing interesting happened with this 
student oscars 
wow 
student [laughter] 
if only but thats the point right this is so data set specific that it cant really generalize it 
cannot dream beyond the data set actually nothing interesting happens it is just a lot of 
these  men  are  wearing  brown  suits  and  in  the  data  set  unfortunately  all  brown  things 
were  dogs  [laughter]  so  this  is  what  will  happen  we  will  start  seeing  dogs  appear 
everywhere you see one here 
student [laughter] 
you see many here actually 
student 
it  is  like  a  few  more  and  this  would  have  turned  into  [laughter]  something  unpleasant 
right so that is what is happening actually see a lot of dogs here here in many places 
right 
so this is its still running so what exactly is happening here the same thing that i had 
detected  right  the  network  has  been  trained  to  detect  certain  patterns  dogs  cats  birds 
etcetera which appear frequently in the imagenet data and with these backgrounds that i 
am trying to do or these textures that i have in my images it starts seeing these patterns 
even  when  they  hardly  exist  and  now  as  i  start  focusing  on  these  neurons  which  are 
firing and try to modify the image to make them fire even more it will start producing 
these pixels or these images in the original image right 
so you can read this explanation which is from the google blog on this they have some 
really some code and something on this so you can just read this explanation if a cloud 
looks a little bit like a bird so that will make it look more like a bird this in turn will 
make  the  network  recognize  the  bird  even  more  strongly  on  the  next  pass  and  so  forth 
until out of nowhere a bird actually starts appearing in the image right so that is exactly 
what is happening so this is deep dream
