mcculloch pitts neuron 
let us start with module two which is about mcculloch pitts neuron 
so as we are done this during the history lecture way back in one thousand, nine hundred and forty-three mcculloch and pitts 
they proposed highly simplified computational model of the brain so now let us see 
what’s the motivation we know that our brain is capable of very complex processing 
it’s capable of taking a lot of inputs from various sources and then help us taking various 
decisions and actions now what if you want a computer to do this we want a module 
which is very similar to how the brain works or at least how we think the brain works 
which takes a lot of inputs and then does some processing and helps us take a decision 
so what they proposed is this model which will take a lot of inputs and these inputs are 
all binary all these inputs that you see here these inputs are fed to this mcculloch pitts 
neuron  which is an artificial neuron and it is divided into two parts  so  the first part 
collects all the input so remember you had these dendrites which were taking all the 
information from everywhere  so  this just collects all the information and then the 
second part is aggregation  i  have collected a lot of information from all the sources 
now the second function will decide what this aggregation is and based on that it will 
take a decision whether to fire or not 
so the output is again boolean if it’s zero then neuron does not fire if it’s one the neuron 
fires  so  let us take a concrete example so suppose  i  am trying to make a decision 
whether i should watch a movie or not so x1 could be is the genre of the movie thriller 
similarly there could be another variable say xn which says is the actor matt damon 
so these are all various such factors that i could take is the director christopher nolan 
the music given by someone and so on so all these are probably factors which help me 
decide whether i want to watch this movie or not and you want this neuron to help us 
make that decision 
so now what is happening here is these all inputs they can be either excitatory or 
inhibitory so let me tell you what inhibitory is first so you are taking input from a lot 
of sources now see one of these sources or one of these inputs is am i ill today am i 
down with  fever  so  if  that input is  on irrespective  of  who the actor  director  or 
whatever is i am not going to watch the movie right because i just cannot leave from my 
bed so these are known as inhibitory inputs irrespective of what else is on in your input 
features if this input is on your output is always going to be zero that means the neuron 
is never going to fire so you could think of it as suppose my mood is not good today i 
do not feel like getting up or  if i injured my leg or anything  right if  any of these 
conditions is on irrespective of what the other factors are i am not going to watch the 
movie 
so that is an inhibitory input and excitatory input are on the other hand is not something 
which will cause the neuron to fire on its own but it combine with all the other inputs 
that you have seen could cause the neuron to fire and how so this is how so these are 
all the inputs that your neuron is taking all i am going to do is i am going to take a sum 
of these 
i am going to take aggregation of all of these so what does this count actually give me 
the number of inputs which are on the number of inputs which are value one that is all 
this aggregate this is a sum of all the one's in my input 
now this is what g does this is a very simple function is taking a sum of my inputs 
now the function y takes this as the input that means it takes this sum as the input and 
if the sum is greater than a certain threshold then it fires  if the sum is less than the 
certain threshold then it does not fire so again see what is happening here is it is same 
as now if you depend on the actor director and genre and so on and you fine at least 
two of these three conditions are satisfied at least i am happy with the actor and the 
director even though the genre is not something that i care about 
i will watch the movie or you might be a very niche go movie watcher who only goes to 
a movie if the actor matches your requirement the director matches your requirement 
and the genre and the music and everything matches your requirement  so  you are 
threshold in that case it should be high so this is how it is going to help you make 
decisions now again a very simplified model and this is theta is called the thresholding 
parameter that is the value which decides whether the neuron is going to fire or not and 
this over all thing is known as the thresholding logic so this is what a mcculloch pitts 
neuron looks like 
now let us implement some boolean functions using this mp neuron so from now on i 
will just called it mp neuron and we will try to implement some boolean functions using 
it so now why are we interested in boolean functions it is because we have overly 
simplified the way we take decisions we are saying that the way we take decisions is we 
take a lot of boolean inputs is actor matt damon and genre thriller and so on and based 
on that we produce a boolean output 
so an input is all booleans so we have x1 to xn which are all booleans and your output 
is also boolean so that is a boolean function that you are trying to learn from x to y is 
that clear you have x just happens to contain n different variables here ok and lot of 
decision problems you could cast in this framework you can just imagine right whether 
to come for lecture  today or not  again is you could cast in it depending on various 
boolean inputs 
this is a very concise representation of the mcculloch pitts neuron what it says is it 
takes a few boolean inputs and it has certain threshold if the sum of these inputs crosses 
this  threshold then the neuron will fire otherwise it will not fire that is the simple 
representation of the m p neuron now suppose i am trying to learn the and function 
when would the and function fire 
all the inputs are on so what should be the value of the threshold in this case 
three everyone agrees what about the or function 
one let us see a few more this function so let me tell you what this function is so 
you see this circle here so that means that this input is an inhibitory input if that is on 
then the neuron is not going to fire that is how i am representing it so now tell me 
what should the threshold for this be it is not so hard 
see if x2 is on it is not going to fire so you have four rows zero zero zero one one zero one one so two of 
those are ruled out and it is not going to fire now out of the remaining two when do 
you wanted to fire 
so what should be the threshold 
one  now what about this function  zero or three three  is not even a valid option  zero  everyone 
agrees to that and what about this zero so you get this so now if you have a certain 
number of input variables and the function that you are trying to model the decision that 
you are trying to make is a boolean function then you could represent using these mp 
neurons whether all boolean functions can be represented in this way or not that is still 
not clear i am just showed you some good examples we will come to the bad examples 
later on here is the question 
so can any boolean function be represented using a mcculloch pitts neuron so before 
answering this question we will see a bit of a geometric interpretation of what mp 
neuron is actually trying to do 
so  let us take or function where you have two inputs x1 and x2 and this neuron is 
going to fire 
if x1 plus x2 is greater than equal to one that is clear that is how the definition is now 
if you look at this x1 plus x2 greater than equal to one now let us ignore the greater than 
part first so we will just talk about x1 plus x2 equal to one what is this equation of a 
line everyone gets that ok now in this case since we are dealing with boolean inputs 
and we have two access x1 and x2 how many input points can we have four right zero zero zero one 
one zero one one 
so you could have these four points so just note that this is an x1 and x2 axis but only 
four inputs are valid here this is not a real numbered access this is only boolean inputs 
possible here 
now what is the line x1 plus x2 equal to one tell you which line is that 
so one which passes through one zero here and zero one here this is that line now what do we 
want that for all those inputs for which the output is actually one they should lie on the line 
or on the positive side on the line and all those inputs for which the output is zero they 
should lie on the other side of the line is that happening so what is actually mp in unit 
actually learning linear decision boundary it just what it is doing in effect is actually it is 
dividing the input points into two halves such that all the points lying on that line right 
are sorry all the points for which the input should be zero lie below this line and all the 
points for which the output should be one sorry in both cases it should have been output 
so let me just repeat it all the points for which the output is zero lie below this line and all 
the points for which the output is one either lie on this line or above the line is that fine 
and so let us convince ourselves about this  even it is not already clear from the 
equation for how many of you it is already cleared from the equation that this is exactly 
what it does for a large number of periods but still we will just do a few examples and 
move ahead 
now for the and function what is the decision boundary it is x1 plus x2 no that is 
the decision boundary 
equal to two so again i have these four points only these four points are possible now 
where is my decision line 
passing through that one one and intercepting this somewhere around two zero and this around zero 
two so that is the line which i am interested in now again do you see that our condition 
is satisfied that all the inputs for which we want the output to be one are on or above the 
line and all the inputs for which we want the output to be zero or below the line now what 
about this function what is the threshold 
zero so what would the line be x1 plus x2 equal to zero which passes through the origin 
right and again all the points are either on or above the line so this part we are going to 
call as a positive half space and this we are going to call as the negative half space 
now what if we have more than two inputs in a two dimensional case when we just 
had x1 and x2 we are trying to find a separating line in the three dimension case what 
will we do 
plane in the higher dimensions 
hyper plane so this is now your three dimensional case again there are three axis here 
but not all points are possible how many points are possible eight points and which is the 
function that we are trying to implement 
or  so for these eight out of these eight points for how many is the output one 
seven and for one it is zero so what is the kind of plane that we are looking at we are looking 
for a plane such that seven points lie on or above it and one point lies below it and which is that 
point 
zero so now what is the equation of that hyper plane x one plus x two plus x three is equal to one 
you see this so you see that all the seven points are visible but the points zero zero is not 
visible because it is on the other side of the plane so this is doable in three dimensions 
also and again in higher dimensions also right we could find in hyper plane 
so the story so far is that single mcculloch pitts neuron can be used to represent 
boolean functions which are linearly separable so a linearly separable function is such 
that there exists a line such that for that function whichever points produce an output of one 
lie on one side of the line and whichever points produce an output zero lie on the other side 
of the line
