errors and error surfaces 
before we go to the next section which is on learning  i  just want to introduce the 
concept of errors and error surfaces and tell you  what it relates to these multiple 
solutions that we were talking about 
so for simplicity what we will do is we will just set the threshold to minus or minus w 
to one which is setting the threshold to minus one and now i will try different values of w1 
and w2 ok so i was saying that there are multiple values of w1 and w2 possible and 
these are all real numbers we are not constrained by having them as boolean values so 
now this is one solution which i tried i tried setting w1 to minus one and w2 to minus one 
what is wrong with this line does it lead to any errors how many 
just one error so this makes an error of one out of the four inputs now let me just try some 
other values of w1 and w2 this line again one error what about this line  not four three 
because zero zero is anyways on this side of a line 
so now given this now tell me that i my quest is to find these w so i would want to 
find w1 w2 and so on given this discussion on errors can you tell me a condition that i 
am looking for i want to find w1 w2 or up to wn such that errors are minimized and in 
the best case errors are zero so that is what i want so this just i want to make a case that 
these search for w’s is driven by certain objective and this objective is to minimize the 
error 
so now since we are doing this let us plot the error surface corresponding to different 
values of w naught w1 and w2 
once again for simpler analysis we will just keep w naught to be fixed at minus one and 
now what i have so just do not read this bullet as of now even this one so i have this 
w2 here so that is my one axis and i have w1 here which is my another axis now what 
i am going to do is i am going to try different values of w1 and w2 so this axis can go 
from minus infinity to plus infinity of course for showing the sake of showing here i 
have just had it from minus four to four 
so now what i am going to do is i am searching for some values of w’s w1 and w2 so 
that my errors is zero and let us do a brute force and i will just try every value between 
minus four to four ok in fact one of the solutions which i proposed actually was this eleven eleven 
right that is the line which we saw on the previous slide and which led to zero errors and 
that is the dark blue surface here  so  how did i compute this error actually i just 
substituted minus sorry eleven eleven here and then i put in all the four values combinations 
for x1 x two and i realized that i am able to satisfy all of them so i do not get any error 
now instead of that if i had put something different 
so let me just go back to the previous slide which was see minus one minus one which is i 
think yeah somewhere around here right minus one minus one i guess so for that i am in 
this light blue region where the error was one i make errors for one of the inputs so it 
is a very brute force way of finding this and this is not going to work because we have 
lots of inputs to check  but  this is just to give you an intuition that we are looking at 
errors and we are trying to find a value of w1 w2 which minimize this error so that is 
the idea behind errors and error surfaces
