hello everyone welcome to lecture one of cs7 fifteen which is the course on deep learning 
in  todayâ€™s lecture is going to be a bit non technical we are not going to cover any 
technical concepts  or  we only going to talk about a brief or partial history of deep 
learning 
so we hear the terms artificial neural networks artificial neurons quite often these days 
and i just wanted you take you through the journey of where does all these originate 
from and this history contains several spans across several fields not just computer 
science we will start with biology then talk about something in physics then eventually 
come to computer science and so on so with that let us start 
so just some acknowledgments and disclaimers i have taken lot of this material from 
the first people which i have mentioned on the bullet and there might still be some errors 
because its dates as back as one thousand, eight hundred and seventy-one so maybe i have got some of the facts wrong so feel 
free to contact me if you think some of these portions need to be corrected and it would 
be good if you could provide me appropriate references for these corrections 
so let us start with the first chapter which is on biological neurons as i said its spans 
several fields will start with biology 
and we will first talk about the brain and neurons within the brainso  way back in 
one thousand, eight hundred and seventy-one one thousand, eight hundred and seventy-three around that time joseph von gerlach actually proposed that the nervous 
system our nervous system is a single continuous network as opposed to a network of 
many discrete cells 
so his idea was that this is one gigantic cell sitting in our nervous system and it is not a 
network of discrete cells and this theory was known as the reticular theory 
and around the same time there was the some breakthrough or some progress in staining 
techniques where camillo golgi discovered that a chemical reaction that would allow 
you to examine the neurons or the nervous tissue 
so he was looking at this nervous tissue using some staining technique and by looking at 
what you see in this figure on the right hand side the yellow figure even he concluded 
that this is just once single cell and not a network of discrete cells so he was again a 
proponent of reticular theory so this is about camillo golgi 
and then interestingly santiago cajal he used the same technique which golgi proposed 
and he studied the same tissue and he came up with the conclusion that this is not a 
single cell this is actually a collection of various discrete cells which together forms a 
network so it is a network of things as opposed to a single cell there so that is what 
his theory was and this was eventually came to be known as the neuron doctrine 
although this was not a consolidated in the form of a doctrine by cajal that was done by 
this gentleman so he coined the term neuron so now today when you think about art 
here   about  artificial   neural   networks   or   artificial   neurons   the  term   neuron   actually 
originated way back in one thousand, eight hundred and ninety-one and this gentleman was responsible for coining that 
and he was also responsible for consolidating the neuron doctrine so already as you 
saw on the previous slide cajal had proposed it but then over the years many people 
bought this  idea and  this  guy was responsible for  consolidating   that into   a neuron 
doctrine interestingly he is not only responsible for coining the term neuron he is also 
responsible for coining the term chromosome so two very important terms were coined 
by this one person 
so now here is a question so around one thousand, nine hundred and six when it was time to give the nobel prize in 
medicine what do you think which of these two proponents say there are two theories 
one is reticular theory which is a single cell and then there is this neuron doctrine which 
is a collection of cells or collection of neurons that a nervous system is a collection of 
neurons so what do you think which of these two guys who are proponents of these two 
different theories who would have got the actual nobel prize for medicine 
so interestingly it was given to both of them so till one thousand, nine hundred and six in fact way later till one thousand, nine hundred and fifty 
also this debate was not completely set settled and then the committee said both of these 
are interesting pieces of work we yet do not know what really actual what the situation 
is actually but these conflicting ideas have a place together and so the nobel prize was 
actually given to both of them and this led to a history of a some kind of controversies 
between these two scientists and so on 
and this debate surprisingly was settled way later in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty and not by progress in biology 
as such but by progress in a different field 
so this was with the advent of electron microscopy so now it was able to see this at a 
much better scale and by looking at this under a microscope it was found that actually 
there is a gap between these neurons and hence it is not a one single cell it is actually a 
collection or a network of cells with a clear gap between them or some connections 
between them which are now known as synapses so this was when the debate was 
settled 
so now why am i talking about biology why am i telling you about biological neuron 
and so on so this is what we need to understand so there has always been interested in 
understanding how the human brain works from a biological perspective at least and 
around this time the debate was more or less settled that we have this our brain is a 
collection of many neurons and they interact with each other to help us do a lot of 
complex processing that we do on a daily basis right from getting up in the morning and 
deciding what do we want to do today taking decisions performing computations and 
various complex things that our brain is capable of doing 
now the interest is in seeing if we understand how the brain works can we make an 
artificial model for that so can we come up with something which can simulate how our 
brain works and what is that model and how do we make a computer do that or how do 
we make a machine do that so that is why i started from biological neurons to take the 
inspiration from biology
