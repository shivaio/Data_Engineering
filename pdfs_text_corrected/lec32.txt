information content entropy & cross entropy 
so for the next module we need something known as cross entropy so we will just try 
to make some develop some intuitions for cross entropy and get to the formula for that 
and then i will tell you how it relates to the problems that we deal with ok so first let 
us start with something simple that what is it that we are trying to do ok so with that i 
will give you an example and i will ask you a few questions and then from there we will 
slightly try  to go towards  cross  entropy so  now suppose you have an  urn which  has 
thousands of balls and these balls are of three different colors which are red black and 
white 
so you have an urn which has three different types of and there are many such balls 
which you have put in it and since you have put in it you know how many red balls are 
there how many blue balls are there and how many white balls are there so for you it 
is very easy to compute the probability of each of these things 
so that is say our probability is twenty-five thirty-five and four now talking more formally what is 
happening here is that you have a random variable x which can take on the values red 
blue or white right and this is the probability of each of those or the random variable x 
taking any of these values ok so this is the setup now i am your friend and you tell me 
that you can peep into the zone you cannot actually count take out all the balls and count 
them and estimate the probability we can just take a look into this and try to give me an 
estimate of what these actually what are these probability values that means what is the 
value 
so what is the probability that x is equal to red or x equal to white or x equal to blue 
so i just take a look at it turn it around a bit and try to get some feel ok i see a lot of 
red balls but a fewer blue balls or white balls and so on and based on that i make my 
best estimate right so i will just say that maybe these probabilities are thirty-five forty-five and 
two right so this is actually the true distribution i will call it as p right because this is 
the correct one and what i have estimated i will call it as q 
and remember now p has you can think of p as a vector which has these three values p one p 
two p three because there are three possible events here and similarly q has three values q one q two and 
q three so in this case i clearly know that i am wrong or when i give you these values you 
know that you are wrong so you tell me that whatever you have estimated is wrong 
then i obviously ask you tell me how wrong was i so how would you give me that 
number that is the thing that we are interested in 
so the general problem that we are interested in is that there is a true probability 
distribution and there is an estimated probability distribution and we want to find out 
how bad was the estimation now can you tell me a simple way of computing this it 
may not be correct but still it makes sense 
student squared error 
you can just take the squared error so what you are essentially telling me is that you 
could just treat these two as any other vector right and you could take the squared error 
difference between these quantities  so what you are telling me is this where i goes 
from one to three ok so this is one valid way of doing this but then we are ignoring the fact 
that this is a distribution and hence it has certain properties that the sum of the elements 
is one and so on all of them are positive and things like that so we are ignoring those kind 
of things we are completely ignoring the fact that we are not dealing with a normal 
vector but a spatial vector which happens to be a distribution so now we want to find 
out a more principled way of computing the difference between two distributions and in 
practice why are we interested in this because we will always have a true distribution 
and a predicted distribution so that is what we want to do we have some way of 
computing it but you want a better way of computing it 
now let me make a case for why do we care about such differences right so let me take 
a simple case of a classification  problem  and to motivate that i will start from a 
different example and then i will come to the classification problem suppose there is a 
tournament going on and there were four teams which leads the semifinals let us call them 
a b c d ok now you were following the tournament up to the semifinals and after 
that you didnâ€™t watch the tournament and you do not know who eventually won well 
the tournament is over and someone has won it 
i actually watched the tournament and i know that b has won it now can i express this 
in terms of a probability distribution right so first let us look at what is the random 
variable here what is a random variable here the team which won right so that is my 
random variable and it can take one of these four values 
now i know that team b won because i saw the tournament and i have seen that they 
won so now how can i write this as a distribution what is the distribution comprised 
of it comprised of these probabilities assigned to each of these events and there are four 
such events here so how do i write this distribution so what you are telling me is i 
could write it as zero one zero zero 
so essentially they are telling me that all the probability mass is focused on one of these 
outcomes because that is the certain outcome that is already happened no one can 
change it so that is the outcome for this tournament so i know that the probability of 
that even is event is one and everything else is zero so in other words the probability that the 
random variable x takes on the value b is one and everything else is zero 
so what i am trying to tell you is that even for a certain event you could still write it in 
terms of a distribution where all the mass is focused on that event now again i will 
bring the same setup that i did not watch the tournament after the semifinals so now 
you   ask  me  give  me  your   prediction   what  which   team   would   win  or  this   is   the 
prediction which i made before just after the semifinals or just before the semifinals that 
i think one of these teams is going to win the tournament and the chance of each of them 
winning is something like this so i know the teams i follow this sport and i probably 
know that ok b has a very strong team and they have a very good record in the past few 
months and so on so maybe they have a higher probability of winning so these are the 
numbers which i assign 
now again i have made an estimate was my estimate perfect when would it have been 
perfect if i had predicted with certainty won that b is going to win but i was not willing 
to bet everything on b so i said there is a very high chance it will win but there is still 
a chance that there could be some surprises now how wrong was i now again tell me 
can you tell me what is p and what is q here this is the true distribution and this is my 
predicted distribution and what am i interested in again the difference between them 
how wrong did i go and what again what is a simple way of doing this again square 
errors so again this is what my formula would look like 
so this is fine in this toy case but why do we care about in real life examples that we 
are going to deal with in machine learning so in watching learning will deal with a lot 
of   problems   which   are  classification   problems  and   in   classification   problems   you 
would again have this setup where you have a label the good thing of the label as a 
random variable and it could take off one of many values so i will again assume that it 
could take suppose you are trying to take a picture of fruits and you are trying to 
classify them 
and i could again think that i have four fruits say apple banana cherry and dragon fruit 
ok and this random variable can take one of these four values depending on the image that 
i am seeing ok now i have been given some training data so for every training data i 
have been given an image and i have been given the correct label so for that training 
data what is this distribution suppose i have been given the image of a banana what 
does this distribution look like zero one zero zero right again i have seen it so i know it is 
certainly a banana 
so i do not have any confusion all the probability mass is focused on that now the same 
image we are going to show to one of our models ok and it is going to make a 
prediction and will again ask it to give us a distribution the model will give us values 
perhaps like this ok so this is the models prediction again the model has given us a 
distribution and we have a true distribution and we are interested in knowing how wrong 
the model was so that 
student correct the 
we can correct the parameters of the model so this is our dash function loss function 
right so a loss function is some notion of difference between p and q right and so far 
we have been dealing with a very simplistic notion of this difference which is just the 
squared error loss ok and we want to do something better than this right so what i 
have told you is that you could always have a true distribution always have a predicted 
distribution and you would be interested in finding the difference between them that is 
the one first part the second part is that even when you are given something with 
certainty you could still write it as a distribution such that all the mass is focused on that 
event which was which has happened right which was the label was banana in this case 
and then you could still predict this from your model and now you are interested in 
knowing how wrong you are model wind because that is the loss function that you will 
use and then you will try to update your parameters with respect to this loss function 
means that is the setup that we are interested in so that is so i made a case for why we 
need to find differences between two distributions how to do it in a more principled 
manner we have not seen that yet we will get to that ok so before i get that i also need 
to tell you something about expectations so let us written to as sports example where 
there were four teams and say based on pundits and that sport they have said that these are 
the probabilities of winning 
and now you are into betting and you bet place your bets on these teams and you place 
our bets in a way that suppose team events then you end up winning ten k rupees if team 
b wins then probably will end up winning five k rupees and if team c wins probably ten k 
and if one of the other team wins maybe will end up losing money or something like that 
now you want to know what is your expected reward so now let us see what is 
happening here this was a random variable which could take on one of these four values 
these are the probabilities of the random variable taking that value taking on the value 
a or taking on the value b c and d ok this is your value or the gain or the profit 
associated with the random variable taking one of these values 
so you have a random variable you have a probability associated with every value of 
the random variable and you have some gain or value associated with every value of the 
random variable now how do you calculate the expected gain or expected profit which 
is this there is a thirty percent chance that you will earn ten k there is a forty percent chance 
that you will earn five k there is a twenty percent chance that you will earn ten k and ten 
percent chance that you lose thirty k 
so the way you will compute it is that and this is the simple expectation formula which 
is the probability of now the event here belongs to abcd right this is one of the four 
teams that will win probability of that event happening in to the value associated with 
that event happen this is a fair computation you get the intuition that this is how you 
will compute the net reward that you have so this is how you compute the expected 
value with respect to a particular distribution so this is the background that we need 
now i will just go on to the next slide and now we will talk about entropy first perhaps 
information content be first then entropy and then cross sector ok so now what is 
information content 
so now again let us take the same case that we have a random variable which can take 
on values a b c d now let us what we are trying to say is that if i know a certain thing 
what is the information that i have gained so you and i are talking you tell me 
something  and  i  want to   see  whether  my   information  was  enhanced   whether  my 
knowledge was enhanced that is how we will quantify information content 
so if you are talking to me and you tell me that my name is mitesh the zero information 
content for me right because i already know that there is no surprise in that ok but if 
you talk to me and you tell me that today there is going to be a lunar eclipse then there is 
a possibility there is some information content gain for me right because that is not a 
event which happens every day if you just tell me you will see the moon today and you 
live in a region where it is not typically cloudy and there is no information gain there 
right so what do you see here when is the information gained high when the event 
which happens is a very surprising event and how do you say supplies in terms of 
probability 
student 
it is a very low probability event right so if there is again this tournament and say d 
was the weakest team in the tournament and a was the strongest team in the tournament 
if   you   come   and   tell   me   that   d   won   then   i   would   be   really   surprised   that   some 
information which i had gained but if you tell me that a won then probably i already 
knew   it   at   the   back   of   my   mind   because  a is   clearly   the   strongest   team   in   the 
tournament and there is no information gained for me 
so one thing that we are trying to establish that the information content i see ok the 
information content of an event is inversely proportional to the probability of the event 
there is a that is a fair intuition fine now i want am still talking in terms of vague 
things i am saying it is inversely proportional but i still need an exact function so that i 
can compute it so i want something i want a function where i plug in the probability of 
an event and i get the information content of the event 
right now i do not have that function i am just building some intuition towards that 
function ok but this is one requirement that i want the function to satisfy this is 
something that all of us agree with ok now think of two events which are independent a 
and b ok so a is the event whether the ac is on here or not and b is a event which 
tells maybe so let us consider two different random variables 
so x is the random variable which can take on values zero and one sorry so x is again this 
random variable which can take on these four values abcd whether who won in the 
tournament and y is this another random variable which can take on the value on and 
off depending on whether the a câ€™s on in this room or not what can you tell about these 
two random variables they are independent random variables 
so this is on or off and this is which team won the tournament now i come and tell you 
something about the random variable y and i come and tell you something about the 
random variable x ok so now i want you to tell me this what is the information 
content of x and y i tell you something about x and i tell you something about y and 
these two events are in these two random variables are independent then what can you tell me 
about the information content what is the condition that you would want you gain 
some   information   by   knowing   things   about   x   and   you   gain   some   information   by 
knowing things about y so what can you tell me it should be the sum right 
because these two are independent events so whatever information i am getting from 
this random variable and this random variable which together enhancing my information 
right it is not cancelling out anything or is there is no common intersection there right 
if the two events were not independent then i would not expect this to hold because 
knowing something about the first event only tells me something about the second event 
right because they are dependent 
so then that case the information gained would not be additive ok so now let us see i 
already made a case that this function which tells me the information gain is actually 
proportional to the probability ok so that means this is what the input is going to be 
right and then what is the other condition that i want this is a fair thing right i just 
replaced information content by a function and i know that the function should depend 
on the probability because that is what we have established here 
so we know that the function depends on the probability we still do not know what this 
f is exactly but i am trying to impose some conditions on f one condition of f f is that 
this condition should hold ok now let us look at this condition which i have underlined 
this is f of is this fine because it two events are independent you can write them as the joint 
probability as p of x into p of y this is clear to everyone right you seem to be a bit lost 
arvind clear ok 
now what is happening here i have a function f of a into b and that is actually equal to f 
of a plus f of b what family of functions do you know which has this characteristic log 
right that is why log is a good choice for this that is why information content is going 
to be the log of the probability but i wanted to be inversely proportional right so it will 
be log of one by the probability ok so that is why information content of this thing is so 
you see this how did we arrive at this log formula 
and this log can just be to any base it does not matter so all of you get how we arrive 
at the formula for information contained now just give me a minute i need to think of 
what is the next thing that i have to say ok and so we have found out the information 
content of one of these events happening which was the x taking on the value a 
now let us think of this random variable x so here actually i should have said x equal 
to a probability of x equal to a ok it makes sense because the random variable is x and 
the event is x taking on the value a how much information content is in that so if i 
know that x was a how much will i be surprised by it ok now let us take this event this 
random variable x which can take on values a b c and d as i said with each value there 
is a probability associated with it such that this sums to one now i did not need to draw 
this diagram ok i should 
so x is a random variable which can take these four values which each of these values i 
have a probability associated ok so these are the values these are the probability 
values now what do i also have i have the information content associated with each of 
these right and the information content actually tells me the surprise of that evening 
now if i ask you what is the entropy of this random variable x so remember i had this 
case where i was betting i am with every poor outcome i had a value associated with it i 
had the same situation here with every outcome have a probability and i also have a 
value associated with this and the value is the information content 
now if i ask you what is the entropy or the expected information content of this random 
variable then how will you compute that i am asking you for an expectation 
so i will compute summation i belonging to a b c d p of x equal to i information can 
take what is the formula for that 
student minus 
minus i will just take the minus outside ok so this quantity is called the entropy of the 
random variable right it is the expected information content in the random variable 
now   if   you   see   what   would   be   the   expect   entropy   of   a   random   variable   if   it   is 
corresponding to a certain event that means say the sun rises always in the east right 
so what is going to be the entropy of that zero why you will have one of the sums in that 
summation as one log one right and every other sum would be zero into log of something 
so zero into anything is going to be zero even though that quantity is not defined zero into 
anything is going to be zero so the total entropy is going to be zero ok so this is entropy 
now what is it that we are actually interested in cross entropy so we have not gone 
there yet ok so we need to perhaps add one more slide so far everything is clear ok 
so now we are interested in something known as cross entropy 
so there again the situation is that there is something which is the true distribution and 
something which is the predicted distribution now actually before going there so let 
me just erase this off how many of you have thought that entropy is related to the 
number of bits that you need to transmit something do you know why that connection 
exists no now again let us think of this that you are trying to transmit a message 
and that message is again a random variable which can take on four values a b c d so 
think of these as four commands that we are trying to send to someone right and then 
based on that command someone will take some action now in the digital case how will 
you transmit this encode it to bits so what is the encoding that you will use zero zero yeah 
we will come to that zero one one zero one one so how many bits are you actually using for every 
message 
two bits ok for every bit so maybe this is a this is b this is c and this is d so for every 
message you are using two bits let us see actually what when you are doing this what are 
you actually assuming so actually assuming that all of these are equally likely if all of 
these are equally likely can you tell me the information content of any of them it is 
going to be minus log of one by four ok that is actually equal to minus log and this is to the 
base two ok one by four is two raise to minus two that is equal to two 
so the information content is actually equal to the number of bits that you are going to 
use to transmit that message now let us see if this is just in this special case or in a 
different case also suppose this could take eight values how many bits would you use three 
bits right so you will have zero zero zero zero zero one ok and this would be a to h now what are we 
actually assuming here each of these is equally likely what is the probability one by eight 
what is the information content two raise to minus three that is equal to three 
so the number of bits that you actually use to transmit something this can you can talk 
of it in terms of the information content of that now suppose i want to transmit this over 
the long distance so i need to bit be a bit efficient in terms of number of bits that i use 
right so now in this one of these cases suppose it is of the following form right that 
let us look at the case where x can take one of four values and say let me just put the right 
values so i will say one by two one by four one by eight one by eight ok now what is the information 
content of each of these one two three three and this is the message that i am going to send 
so what am i doing here i am using a different number of bits depending on the 
probability of that event why does this make sense why is this a smart thing to do if 
you want to transmit something which you are going to transmit a lot of times you better 
use less number of bits for that and this is exactly what is happening here a was having 
the highest probability and you are using the lowest number of bits for that now what is 
the expected number of bits that i will use up if it is a i will use one if it is b i will use two 
if it is c three and d three 
so what is the expected number of bits that i will use again i have the same situation 
right i want you to cast it into the same situation i have the probability values and with 
each of these guys i have a cost or a value associated what is the cost one bit two bit three bit 
three bit so what is the expectation now can someone compute the expectation one hundred and seventy-five 
actually let me just write it down it would be again i belonging to a b c d p of x equal 
to i into the number of bits that you will use so that is just equal to log of log to the 
base two of p of x equal to i minus one what does this quantity actually this is the entropy 
we just saw this a this is the entropy of the random variable and what is it telling us 
actually that the entropy is one hundred and seventy-five 
so what is the meaning of this actually so on average you will be needing one hundred and seventy-five bits 
whereas if you are assuming everything is equally likely on average you are using two bits 
right so you see that on average you are making some savings here right so that is 
what the entropy tells you if you know what the probability of these events is then you 
better use that to decide the number of bits that you are going to use to send each of 
these 
so   now   let   us   complicate   this   a   bit   more   now   we   have   the   entropy  now   let   us 
complicate it a bit more so there is some true distribution which exists there is some 
true distribution from which these messages are coming right but you do not know 
what that true distributions we never know the true distribution that is the entire problem 
that we have been dealing with in machine learning 
so what you will do is we will somehow try to predict this distribution and this then the 
and the recipe that you will use is the same as that i used for the example where i had an 
urn right so there are these thousands of 10000â€™s of messages which has going to keep 
coming  on you do not have access to the entire stream  but you have seen some 
thousand of those messages just as i had peeped into the urn and i had seen some balls 
and i had made an estimate that i think based on these messages that i have seen so far i 
think these are the actual probabilities 
so the true probabilities are say p one p two p three and p four corresponding to a b c and d i 
do not know what this two properties are but i can estimate them looking at some samples 
or basically using my domain knowledge right maybe i would know that if one of these 
messages is stopped and i am actually trying to talk to a computer or a computer 
program that maybe stop is something which are used very rarely only at the end of the 
program or something so you have some either some domain knowledge or based on 
some samples i can estimate the value of this probability 
and i just try to relate it to the exact example of urns where you had these 10000â€™s of 
balls but you could not see all of them you sampled some and estimated a probability 
here again there is a continuous flow of message you cannot have access to all of these 
because they are going to continue but i have seen some of those and based on that you 
estimate these probabilities now based on this estimation how many bits 
so now this is the estimation that we have now based on this you will decide the 
number of bits that you will use for each of these messages right because you have 
some estimate so you want to be smart you do not want to keep two bits for all of them 
so you will just say that i will use log qi bits for the iâ€™th message 
this is fair thing because i know that the information content is proportional to the 
probability in fact it is exactly given by this formula minus log of qi so based on my 
estimated probability i am going to do this ok and this is the number of bits that i have 
reserved now do you see a problem with this this is my estimation but the data is 
actually going to come from the true distribution it is not going to follow the distribution 
q it is going to follow the distribution p 
so now what is actually happened is this right this is the situation that we are dealing 
with we have p which was a true distribution that is the rate at which the data will 
come but with each of these events the value that we have associated is now related to q 
because q is what i have access to i do not have access to p i just have access to q so i 
have associated a value based on q does this make sense i should have actually used 
log p one bitâ€™s log p two bits and log p three bits but i do not know what p one p two p three are 
i just estimated them based on some samples so that is q one q two q three and these are the 
number of bits that i am using now if i have to compute the expectation how will i do 
it i have to use p because that is the true distribution from which the data is coming 
so   what   would   the   expectation   now   look   like   everyone   gets   this   the   actual 
probabilities are this but because i am poor at estimating them i ended up associating 
these values which could be wrong right because i would have overestimated the 
probability of one of these messages and hence i have reserved lesser bits for that or 
underestimated the probability of one of these events and hence reserved more bits for 
that or vice versa 
i could have assigned a wrong number of bits to them right p no so do we have access 
to p in the sense so someone knows that right i mean there is a again in the same case 
as in the label case right we have access to the true p there and we are estimating a q 
when we are given these images for the training data we know that the distribution is zero one 
zero zero if the image is b for banana 
student 
then it is validated right so now this is what is this quantity called this is called the 
cross entropy ok you get why it is called the cross entropy because now you have two 
different distributions involved here ok you have the q distribution based on which you 
made your decisions you assign values to these events based on the q distribution but 
the true distribution is the p distribution 
so the actual number of bits that you use up on average is going to be based on the true 
probability they try to understand that now what will happen is for event a you have 
assigned a certain number of bits now how many bits will get used up it depends on 
the actual probability of p if that message is repeated many times then that is how this 
summation would be computed 
so  this is  called   the  cross  entropy but now why is  this  the  difference between   two 
distributions that is what we wanted given two distributions we wanted to be able to find 
the difference between them now am telling you that cross entropy is a way of finding 
that difference why is it so so what would you want this difference to what is the 
property that you would want this difference to have if p is equal to q then if p is equal 
to q then 
student 
not zero maybe it should take the lowest possible value right so this function right this 
is actually telling you loss of p comma q right this is what this is and we are calling it 
as the cross entropy this function you take it is minimum value when p is equal to q 
right because now at that point you are not really making any loss that is the best you 
could have done does this function take it is minimum value when p is equal to q yes 
why how is that obvious but why there could be something else which is lower than 
the actual entropy right why how you have to we are trying to minimize something 
so you have to give me answer 
so yeah so let us do that ok so how many of you it is obvious that q is the answer i 
mean the answer is p is equal to q it is not ok now this is the part which i am a bit 
worried about but i will just do it anyways so let me see how do i put this ok so 
remember that we had a p and we had a q and we want to find a q such that this quantity 
is minimized that is what our objective is 
so we want to minimize this with respect to qi ok now how do you find the minimize 
suppose i have this problem how do i find the minimum value how do i find the value 
of x which minimizes this take the derivative and set it to zero ok and then in this case i 
will get x equal to zero is that value can i do the same thing here and suppose it was this 
so now this is a function of two variables again i could do the same thing i could take the 
partial derivatives and set them to zero 
and i will get the minimum value now here this is actually a function of how many 
variables k in general right so q one q two q three up to qk ok now can you try doing the 
same thing can you can you take the derivative and set it to zero this is again a sum right 
it is very similar to this situation it is actually let me just write it down it is p one log q one 
plus p two log q two up to p k log qk 
now i want to take the derivative with respect to one of these guys say q two what would 
it be p two by q two is equal to what will i do that is the derivative p two by q two i will set it 
to zero do i get anything what is it that i am doing wrong here there is something that i 
am deliberately doing wrong is this an unconstrained optimization problem there is a 
constraint on the variables what is the constraint so why my true optimization problem 
is minimize with respect to q iâ€™s such that summation q iâ€™s equal to one 
do you know an easy way of dealing with these problems how many of you know the 
lagrange multiplier how will i use it here what will my objective function become 
then summation of qi minus one lambda then minus ok how many of you understand the 
intuition behind this that is a good answer now let us let me try to explain why this 
makes sense right this is the constraint that we have to operate within this constraint 
what i have done is i have taken the so now if the constraint is not satisfied what will 
happen to this quantity if the constraint is not satisfied that means my summation is 
not equal to one that is what means whether the constraint is not satisfied what will happen 
to this quantity it will be a nonzero quantity right fine then what will happen to my 
overall objective and i think we have made a mistake this should be plus i should add 
it right should be plus no it does not oh the lambda can be ok sorry so let me assume 
this is plus 
so what i am trying to do is that this is my objective function which i am trying to 
minimize i have added another quantity to it if this quantity is not equal to zero then i will 
not be the absolute minimum i will be at the minimum plus something right but if this 
quantity if the constraint is satisfied then this quantity will go to zero then am actually at 
the minimum of the function do you get this right so this is the function that i want to 
minimize i have added some quantity to it now that quantity is actually related to the 
constraint that i do not want to violate if i violate the constraint this is going to be non 
negative right 
so whatever minimum value i achieved i will be slightly higher than that because some 
nonnegative value has got added to it ok is that fine but if the constraint is satisfied 
then i can achieve the minimum value so that is roughly the intuition behind using this 
lagrangian multiplier it is a very crude intuition but there is of course a lot of math 
behind that but i am just giving you the intuition behind this which one 
student 
yeah that is what you could adjust the lambda and ensure that it is not negatively ok so 
now now can you do the same thing can you equate this to zero can you take the derivative 
and equate to zero what will you get now this term will give you p i by q two as before oh 
sorry p two by q two as before plus lambda times yeah plus lambda times one ok fine so 
equal to zero so then what will you end up getting p two is equal to i think it is something 
wrong here now this should be minus p two by k 
so p two is equal to lambda times q two ok and then further actually you can show that 
lambda is going to be equal to one how can you show that your constant is fine so do you 
see how we will get lambda equal to one so what does it actually tell you then p two is 
equal to q two that means all in fact you can show that all p iâ€™s are equal to q iâ€™s that 
means the distribution p is equal to distribution q 
so this cross entropy term will be minimized when your true distribution or when your 
plated  distribution   is   the   same   as   the   true   distribution   and   hence   it   captures   the 
difference between the two ok and that is exactly what we were interested in we were 
interested in a quantity which can allow us to capture the difference between the true 
difference between a true distribution and the predicted distribution 
so we have arrived with that quantity and that quantity is cross entropy so therefore 
for all our classification problems where we have this scenario that we are given the true 
distribution where all the masses focused on one of the labels and you are estimating a 
distribution where you could give non zero quantities to many of those and you want to 
find out how wrong your estimates were with respect to the true distribution you can use 
cross entropy as a measure for that right so now your loss function which you wanted 
to depend on the difference between p and q it can just be the cross entropy between p 
and q
