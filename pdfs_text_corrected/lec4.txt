i will talk about the history of convolutional neural networks and i call this part of 
history as cats and it will become obvious why i call it so 
so around one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-nine hubel and wiesel did this famous experiment they are still i think you 
could see some videos of it on youtube where there is this cat and there was a screen in 
front of it and on the screen there were these lines being displayed at different locations 
and in different orientations so  slanted horizontal vertical and so on and there are 
some electrodes fitted to the cat and they were measuring trying to measure that which 
parts of brain actually respond to different visual stimuli 
let us say if you show it stimulus at a certain location does the different part of the brain 
fire and so on so and one of the things of outcomes of the study was that that different 
neurons in brain fire to only different types of stimuli it is not that all neurons in brain 
always fire to any kind of visual stimuli that you give to them 
so this is essentially roughly the idea behind convolutional neural networks starting 
from something known as neocognitron which was proposed way back in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty you 
could think of it as a very primitive convolutional neural network i am sure that most of 
you have now read about or heard about convolutional neural networks but something 
very similar to it was proposed way back in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty 
and what we know as the modern convolutional neural networks maybe i think yan li 
kun is someone who proposed them way back in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine and he was interested in using 
them for the task of handwritten digit recognition and this was again in the context of 
postal delivery services so lot of pin codes get written or phone numbers get written on 
the postcards and there was a requirement to read them automatically so that they can 
be the letters or postcards can be separated into different categories according to the 
postcard according to the postal code and so on right so or the pin code 
so that is where this interest was there and one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-nine was when this convolutional neural 
networks were first proposed or used for this task 
and then over the years several improvements were done to that and in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight this now 
how   famous   data   set   the   mnist data   set   which   is   used   for   teaching   deep   neural 
networks courses or even for initial experiments with various neural network based 
networks this is one of the popular data sets which is used in this field and this was 
again released way back in one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight and even today even for my course i use it for various 
assignments and so on 
so it is interesting that an algorithm which was inspired by an experiment on cats is 
today used to detect cats in videos of course among other various other things is just i 
am just jokingly saying this
