derivative of the activation function 
we have that activation function and we were taking the derivative of the activation with 
respect to pre activation and i just pushed it under the rug by saying we will write it as 
g dash so i need to show you what g dash is 
what  how  to  compute  g  dash  so  this  is  suppose  g  is  the  logistic  function  ok  so  that 
means what is z actually it is one of those aâ€™s right so this is the activation that you 
are going to feed it right and then you are taking the element wise sorry z is actually the 
pre activation that you feed it and then g is the activation function so i will do element 
wise activation function now what is the derivative of this so i will just i will not do 
this derivation 
it is there and you end up with a very neat formula which is g of z into one minus g of z 
so now that bit is also taken care of is there any more spoon feeding that i can do you 
are ready for the assignment now i will do one more bit you will also have used a tanh 
function so this is the derivative of the tanh function it again boils down to a very neat 
formula which is one minus g of zd whole square so we will end this lecture
