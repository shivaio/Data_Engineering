dataset augmentation 
so  how  with  that  heavy  math  i  will  just  interline  with  this  something  very  simple 
which is something known as dataset augmentation 
so what is dataset augmentation mean so you always given some training data so in 
the case of mnist you had this training data where you are given these digits images 
of digits and  you wanted to train some classifier so in dataset augmentation what we 
do  is  so  now  we  have  what  is  happening  here  right  conceptual  is  that  there  some 
seeing  some  training  data  and  try  to  build  a  classifier  and  what  you  doing  actually  is 
minimizing the empirical train error 
that  mean it will ensure that whatever  you have seen in  training is  going to look  it  is 
going to be perfectly classified whatever we have seen in training that is going to look 
very  good  it  is  going  to  be  the  training  error  on  that  is  the  error  of  those  training 
examples it is going to be very easy 
now my question is this if a training time you are seeing all this 2's which are roughly 
vertically drawn  right and a test time  you see  at  two which is  written like this which is 
slightly  tilted  what  would  happen  it  will  not  be  able  to  do  a  good  job  on  that  that 
means  your  model  is  not  think  of  terms  that  you  have  used  in  this  lecture  not 
generalizing 
can  you  think  of  a  simple  trick  based  on  your  domain  knowledge  of  how  people  right 
digits to kind of overcome overcome this problem you get the question right i am telling 
you that it is possible that someone writes to in a very tilted manner can you prepare for 
eventuality  eventuality  the  title  of  this  module  was  dataset  augmentation  so  what 
would happen is are given some training data 
you can always generate for training data from that see here is another training instant 
that i have created i have just rotate it to two by some random angle i took this image i 
just rotate it and this is a simple operation that all pixels are moving by a certain angle i 
could have rotate it more i could have shifted it vertically that means in all my image 
the two was actually exactly at the centre i just shifted at a bit vertically 
so  i am so  think that you are reading one of those  kyc  forms  or bank forms most 
people would write at the center of the block provided but some people could write to 
the extreme right or extreme left right so you are preparing for that they saying that ok 
all my data the digits are well written at the centre but let me just shift them bit so that 
i can also deal with people who write it at the corner 
left  align  or  right  align  instead  of  center  align  i  could  have  even  shift  it  horizontally 
most people would write at the center but some people would write at the top or at the 
bottom i could blur the image but someone has taken a photo and send it to me and the 
photo  is  not  very  clear or  i  could  just change some pixels randomly  right  i could  add 
noise all of this is  dataset  augmentation with  the hope that  i  am  capturing with  these 
variations i am capturing enough variations in the data 
so  that  i  have  a  better  chance  of  doing  something  better  on  the  test  data  is  that  fine 
this is all still training data mind you i am still going to compute the empherical train 
error  it  is  just  that  now  i  have  blown  up  my  data  but  much  more  than  what  i  had 
initially  do  you  all  see  by  doing  this  you  could  have  done  better  on  the  mnist 
assignment you could have done better again i am not asking you to do this 
so now i will do this then i will have supervised data because i know that by this small 
variations  the  label  is  not  going  to  change  and  what  am  i  using  there  i  am  using  my 
domain  knowledge  right  i  cannot  do  this  always  right  i  hope  you  appreciated  that 
suppose that changes the domain a bit and i am given images of defects of motor parts 
right where i have taken a image and there is a black spot somewhere which indicates 
defect i cannot go about doing the same thing there i cannot change some other pixels it 
will just means that the defects is at a different location right but in many cases you can 
do that 
so  if  you  are  given  picture  because  of  dogs  and  cats  because  the  entire  world  case 
about classifying cats and dogs then you could do some rotations you could blur them a 
bit  you  could  occlude  certain  questions  of  the  picture  and  so  on  and  still  generate 
training data right and what you are trying to do is trying to take care of cases that you 
would  end  up  dealing  at  test    right  is  that  clear  ok  and  please  be 
aware that we are exploiting some domain knowledge here 
typically  more  data  is  better  learning  works  well  for  image  classification  in  object 
recognition these are the task where this is already been tried out and they have shown 
to  work very  well in  these tasks also  shown to work well for speech where the people 
have some speech training data they try to augment it for some task it may not be very 
easy to generate such data right 
so  you  could  think  of  various  nlp  applications  whereas  given  you  a  data  document 
right because always do what joe does in that friends episode do you remember what i 
am talking you see what i am talking about see you wants to write a recommendation 
letter for monika and chandler ok and he has a letter written any replaces every word 
by  it's  best  synonyms  from  the  thesaurus    right  that  says  a  way  of 
generating noisy data and in that case it was actually noisy right so you could think of 
doing here but as happened in that case it will not result in very good transformation 
next for example i remember something right they are very warm hearted people got 
translated  as  they  have  some  warm  cardiograph  or  something  like  that  which  do  not 
make  sense  so  it  is  not  very  easy  in  almost  all  application  should  do  it  but  in  some 
applications typically in vision application this is easy to do and  you would gain  a lot 
by doing this right
